This data was accessed via Harvard Dataverse, a publicly available database housing this 2019 study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where MIT Election Data and Science Lab collects, examines, and distributes election data. At the same time, the data was curated from the American Community Survey and election results. It is a collection of demographic, past federal, and past state election data for counties in the United States from 2012 to 2016. The missing values from two counties were not registered in the data set but there is not explanation as why that happened.\nThis maps shows the “winning” candidate per county, meaning the candidate with majority of total votes. Although it can be observed a majority red, or counties were Trump was more voted than Clinton, Minnesota was a “blue state” in 2016, meaning that the 10 electoral votes of the state were given to Hillary Clinton. Without knowing the electoral system of the US, this visualization could be misleading regard the political support of the state in the 2016 presidential election. It is important to note that more populated counties are blue, which also seems to relate to their geographical location in main cities of the state.",

    "text": "Exercise 1: RStudio\nExercise 2: Console\nWe can use RStudio to do simple calculations using R. Type the following lines in the console, one by one, hitting Return/Enter after each. Take note of what you get. In some cases you might get an error! This error is important to learning how R code does and doesn’t work.\n\n4 + 2\n4/2\n4^2\n4*2\n4(2)\n\n\n4(2) give you an error because it needs the * to multiplicate\n\nExercise 3: Functions\nHaving a calculator is nice, but we’ll typically use built-in functions to perform common (repetitive) and specific tasks. These functions have names and require information, called arguments, in order to run. Functions are called as follows:\nfunction(argument)\nTry out the following functions in the console. Note each function’s name, argument (information it needs to run), and output (i.e. what the function does and produce):\n\nsqrt(9)\nsqrt(25)\nnchar(\"snow\")\nnchar(\"macalester\")\nsqrt(nchar(\"snow\"))\n\n\nthe function sqrt() give you the square root of the number you imput. The nchar() function tell you the number of characters in the word. The last function is a combiantion of the the above, it gives you the square root of the number of characters in the world imputed.\n\nSome functions require more than 1 argument, separated by commas. To keep these straight, we often specify the arguments by name as follows:\nfunction(argument1 = ___, argument2 = ___)\nTry out the following functions in the console. Note each function’s name, argument (information it needs to run), and output (i.e. what the function does and produce):\n\nrep(x = 2, times = 5)\nrep(times = 5, x = 2)\nrep(2, 5)\nrep(5, 2)\nseq(from = 2, to = 10, by = 2)\nseq(2, 10, 2)\nseq(from = 2, to = 10, length = 3)\nseq(2, 10, 3)\n\nNote that R is case-sensitive. Try the following code which uses Seq() instead of seq() (capital case S instead of lower case s). Read the error message and make sure to understand it–you will experience this type of error message a lot! It will happen any time you misspell a function among other reasons we’ll experience later.\n\nSeq(2, 10, 3)\n\nExercise 4: Grammer\nWe’ll learn lots and lots of functions this semester. Nobody has every function memorized. That said, it does help to connect function names with their purpose. Do that for each function you used above.\n\n\nsqrt() = square root\n\nnchar() = number of characters\n\nrep() = repetition\n\nseq() = sequence\nExercise 5: Practice\nUse the functions you learned above to do the following:\n\nCount the number of letters in the word data.\nCreate the sequence 3, 6, 9, 12–do it in more than one ways to do.\nCreate a sequence of 4 numbers that start at 1 and end at 10–do it in more than one ways to do.\nRepeat the number 5 8 times.\nProduce the sequence 3, 6, 9, 12, 3, 6, 9, 12–you need to combine 2 functions\n\n\nnchar(\"data\")\n\n[1] 4\n\nseq(from=3, to=12, by=3)\n\n[1]  3  6  9 12\n\nseq(3,12,3)\n\n[1]  3  6  9 12\n\nseq(1,10,3)\n\n[1]  1  4  7 10\n\nseq(from = 1, to = 10, length = 4)\n\n[1]  1  4  7 10\n\nrep(5,8)\n\n[1] 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n\nrep(seq(3,12,3),2)\n\n[1]  3  6  9 12  3  6  9 12\n\n\nExercise 6: Variables\nFor reasons that will become clear in the future, we’ll often want to store some R output for later. We can so so using the assignment operator as follows:\nname &lt;- output\nIn the above assignment statement:\n\n\nname is the name under which to store a result\n\noutput is the result we wish to store\n\n&lt;- is the assignment operator–you can think of this as an arrow pointing the output into the name.\n\nTry out each line one at a time. Some lines will not show any output. Why?\n\ndegrees_c &lt;- -13\ndegrees_c\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRuning Code Line by Line\n\n\n\nTo run a single line of code, place the cursor at any position of that line then hit ctrl/cmd+enter/return\n\n\nLet’s now use what we stored. Again, do this one by one.\n\ndegrees_c * (9/5) + 32\ndegrees_f &lt;- degrees_c * (9/5) + 32\ndegrees_f\n\nFinally, try to print degrees_tomorrow. Take time to read the error message. You will experience this type of error message a lot! It will happen when you either haven’t yet defined the object you’re trying to use or you’ve misspelled its name among other reasons we’ll experience later.\n\ndegrees_tomorrow\n\nExercise 7: Practice\n\nName and store your current age in years.\nConfirm that your age is stored correctly by typing the name and pressing return/enter.\nUse your stored age to calculate how old you’ll be in 17 years.\n\n\nkirsty_age &lt;- 20\nkirsty_age\n\n[1] 20\n\nkirsty_age+17\n\n[1] 37\n\n\nExercise 8: Code Styling\nIt’s important to recognize that code is a form of communication, both to yourself and others. Code structure and details are important to readability and clarity just as grammar, punctuation, spelling, paragraphs, and line spacing are important in written essays. All of the code below works, but has bad structure. Discuss with your partner what is unfortunate about each line.\n\nseq(from=1,to=9,by=2)\nseq(from = 1, to=9,by=2)\nmy_output &lt;- -13\nthisisthetemperaturetodayincelsius &lt;- -13\nthis_is_the_temperature_today_in_celsius &lt;- -13\n\nWhen writing code, avoid smooshy ones similar to the following:\n\n# BAD: tough to read\nseq(from=1,to=9,by=2)\n\n# GOOD: spaces between \"words\" and punctuation helps\nseq(from = 1, to = 9, by = 2)\n\nWhen naming your variables:\n\nuse meaningful names,\nmake them short if possible\nsplit up multiple-word names using snake_case or camelCase\n\n\n\n# BAD: too smooshy and hard to read\ndegreescelsius &lt;- -13\n\n# BETTER but not the R-way of naming variables\n# Why is it called camel case?\ndegreesCelsius &lt;- -13\n\n# BETTER\ndegrees_celsius &lt;- -13\n\nIt’s also impossible, not just ill-advised to start names with numbers or symbols, or to use certain symbols in our names. Try the followings:\n\n1_18_24_degrees_c &lt;- -13\n_degrees_c &lt;- -13\nJan/18/24/degrees &lt;- -13\n\nExercise 9: Mistakes & Help\nMistakes are common when learning any new language. You’ll get better and better at interpreting error messages, finding help, and fixing errors. These are all important skills in computer programming in general.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsole Shortcut\n\n\n\nWith your cursor at the next prompt in the console (&gt;), press the up arrow multiple times. What does this do?! This shortcut will be very handy when you make mistakes and want to modify your code without having to start over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelp Files\n\n\n\nYou’ll often forget how functions are used. Luckily, there’s typically built-in documentation for built-in functions that can be invoked using the ? operator.\n\n\nLet’s practice:\n\nIn the console, type ?rep and press return/enter.\nCheck out the documentation file that pops up in the Help pane.\nQuickly scroll through, noting the type of information provided.\nStop at the Examples at the bottom. Perhaps the most useful section, this is where a function’s functionality is demonstrated! Try out a couple of the provided examples in your console.\nExercise 10: History & Environment\nFinally, let’s leave the console.\n\nCheck out the Environment pane of RStudio. What do you observe there and when might this be helpful? &gt; All the values I have created\nSimilarly, check out the History pane of RStudio. What do you observe there and when might this be helpful? &gt; What I have type in my console, to revise my code, find errors.",

    "text": "12.1.1 Exercise 1: Research Questions\nLet’s dig into the hikes data, starting with the elevation and difficulty ratings of the hikes:\n\nhead(hikes)\n\n             peak elevation difficulty ascent length time    rating\n1     Mt. Marcy        5344          5   3166   14.8 10.0  moderate\n2 Algonquin Peak       5114          5   2936    9.6  9.0  moderate\n3   Mt.

Try running the following chunk and simply take note of the error message – this is one you’ll get a lot!\n\n# Use the ggplot function\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating))\n\nIn order to use ggplot tools, we have to first load the tidyverse package in which they live. We’ve installed the package but we need to tell R when we want to use it. Run the chunk below to load the library. You’ll need to do this within any .qmd file that uses ggplot().\n\n# Load the package\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n12.1.3 Exercise 3: Bar Chart of Ratings - Part 1\nConsider some specific research questions about the difficulty rating of the hikes:\n\nHow many hikes fall into each category?\nAre the hikes evenly distributed among these categories, or are some more common than others?\n\nAll of these questions can be answered with: (1) a bar chart; of (2) the categorical data recorded in the rating column. First, set up the plotting frame:\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating))\n\nThink about:\n\nWhat did this do? What do you observe? &gt; This ggplot indicates that the information is being take from the data set hikes and the x-axis will be the rating column\nWhat, in general, is the first argument of the ggplot() function? &gt; The name of the data set we are taking variables from\nWhat is the purpose of writing x = rating? &gt; Assigned the x-axis the variables of the column rating\nWhat do you think aes stands for?!? &gt; It stands for aesthetic\n\n12.1.4 Exercise 4: Bar Chart of Ratings - Part 2\nNow let’s add a geometric layer to the frame / canvas, and start customizing the plot’s theme. To this end, try each chunk below, one by one. In each chunk, make a comment about how both the code and the corresponding plot both changed.\nNOTE:\n\nPay attention to the general code properties and structure, not memorization.\nNot all of these are “good” plots. We’re just exploring ggplot.\n\n\n# This code add a geometric visualization call geom_bar, which refers to a bar plot.\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n# This code add labels to the x and y-axis.\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  labs(x = \"Rating\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n# This code add color to the fill of the bar plot\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar(fill = \"blue\") +\n  labs(x = \"Rating\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n# This code add a minimal theme which simplifies the plot design.\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar(color = \"orange\", fill = \"blue\")  +\n  labs(x = \"Rating\", y = \"Number of hikes\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n12.1.5 Exercise 5: Bar Chart Follow-up\n\n12.1.5.1 Part a\nReflect on the ggplot() code.\n\nWhat’s the purpose of the +? When do we use it? &gt; It allows you to add “instructions” to the code and customized the visualization.\nWe added the bars using geom_bar()? Why “geom”? &gt; It comes form geometric elements\nWhat does labs() stand for? &gt; labels\nWhat’s the difference between color and fill? &gt; colors is the outline while fill paint the inside of the bar\n\n12.1.5.2 Part b\nIn general, bar charts allow us to examine the following properties of a categorical variable:\n\nobserved categories: What categories did we observe? &gt; Difficulty rating: difficult, easy, moderate.\nvariability between categories: Are observations evenly spread out among the categories, or are some categories more common than others? &gt; The moderate categorie is more common than eady and difficult ones.\n\nWe must then translate this information into the context of our analysis, here hikes in the Adirondacks. Summarize below what you learned from the bar chart, in context.\n\n12.1.5.3 Part c\nIs there anything you don’t like about this barplot? For example: check out the x-axis again. &gt; The difficulty ratings are not in order, I would like it to be from easy towards difficult because otherwise could be misleading.\n\n12.1.6 Exercise 6: Sad Bar Chart\nLet’s now consider some research questions related to the quantitative elevation variable:\n\nAmong the hikes, what’s the range of elevation and how are the hikes distributed within this range (e.g. evenly, in clumps, “normally”)?\nWhat’s a typical elevation?\nAre there any outliers, i.e. hikes that have unusually high or low elevations?\n\nHere:\n\nConstruct a bar chart of the quantitative elevation variable.\nExplain why this might not be an effective visualization for this and other quantitative variables. (What questions does / doesn’t it help answer?)\n\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\nBar chart is not an effective visualization for quantitative variables because the data recorded is specific for each peak and therefore a singular bar will be created for each make it hard to read and compared. It could help ask the question of how many peaks have the same elevation but for example in this data set this happens twice as much, therefore the information might not be meaningful.\n\n\n12.1.7 Exercise 7: A Histogram of Elevation\nQuantitative variables require different viz than categorical variables. Especially when there are many possible outcomes of the quantitative variable. It’s typically insufficient to simply count up the number of times we’ve observed a particular outcome as the bar graph did above. It gives us a sense of ranges and typical outcomes, but not a good sense of how the observations are distributed across this range. We’ll explore two methods for graphing quantitative variables: histograms and density plots.\nHistograms are constructed by (1) dividing up the observed range of the variable into ‘bins’ of equal width; and (2) counting up the number of cases that fall into each bin. Check out the example below:\n\n\n12.1.7.1 Part a\nLet’s dig into some details.\n\nHow many hikes have an elevation between 4500 and 4700 feet? &gt; Approx 6 hikes\nHow many total hikes have an elevation of at least 5100 feet? &gt; Around 2 hikes\n\n12.1.7.2 Part b\nNow the bigger picture. In general, histograms allow us to examine the following properties of a quantitative variable:\n\n\ntypical outcome: Where’s the center of the data points? What’s typical?\n\nvariability & range: How spread out are the outcomes? What are the max and min outcomes?\n\nshape: How are values distributed along the observed range? Is the distribution symmetric, right-skewed, left-skewed, bi-modal, or uniform (flat)?\n\noutliers: Are there any outliers, i.e. outcomes that are unusually large/small?\n\nWe must then translate this information into the context of our analysis, here hikes in the Adirondacks. Addressing each of the features in the above list, summarize below what you learned from the histogram, in context. &gt; The range of elecation in the hikes in the Adirondacks is between 4,000 and 5,500 feet. The visualization is a negative riht-skewed, which means that hikes with less elevation are more common than the ones with less elevation.\n\n12.1.8 Exercise 8: Building Histograms - Part 1\n2-MINUTE CHALLENGE: Thinking of the bar chart code, try to intuit what line you can tack on to the below frame of elevation to add a histogram layer. Don’t forget a +. If it doesn’t come to you within 2 minutes, no problem – all will be revealed in the next exercise.\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\n\n12.1.9 Exercise 9: Building Histograms - Part 2\nLet’s build some histograms. Try each chunk below, one by one. In each chunk, make a comment about how both the code and the corresponding plot both changed.\n\n# This code adda an histogram layer\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\n\n# This code adds a white outline to the histogram\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\") \n\n\n# This code a fill color to the histogram\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", fill = \"blue\") \n\n\n# This code as labels to the x and y-axis\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\") +\n  labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n# This code increased the width of the histogram's bins\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 1000) +\n  labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n# This code decreased the width of the histogram's bins\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 5) +\n  labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n# This code changed the width of the histogram's bins to 200\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 200) +\n  labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n12.1.10 Exercise 10: Histogram Follow-up\n\nWhat function added the histogram layer / geometry? &gt; geom_histogram\nWhat’s the difference between color and fill? &gt; the color outline the shape of the plot while the fill put color to the binss\nWhy does adding color = \"white\" improve the visualization? &gt; It highlights each bin and improve the analysis of the visualization.\nWhat did binwidth do? &gt; change the width of the bins in the histograms\nWhy does the histogram become ineffective if the binwidth is too big (e.g. 1000 feet)? &gt; The vizualization cannot show all the data points.\nWhy does the histogram become ineffective if the binwidth is too small (e.g. 5 feet)? &gt; The histogram becomes harder to read and the difference between bins get lost.\n\n12.1.11 Exercise 11: Density Plots\nDensity plots are essentially smooth versions of the histogram. Instead of sorting observations into discrete bins, the “density” of observations is calculated across the entire range of outcomes. The greater the number of observations, the greater the density! The density is then scaled so that the area under the density curve always equals 1 and the area under any fraction of the curve represents the fraction of cases that lie in that range.\nCheck out a density plot of elevation. Notice that the y-axis (density) has no contextual interpretation – it’s a relative measure. The higher the density, the more common are elevations in that range.\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_density()\n\nQuestions\n\n\nINTUITION CHECK: Before tweaking the code and thinking back to geom_bar() and geom_histogram(), how do you anticipate the following code will change the plot?\n\ngeom_density(color = \"blue\")\ngeom_density(fill = \"orange\")\n\n\nTRY IT! Test out those lines in the chunk below. Was your intuition correct?\n\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_density(color = \"blue\", fill = \"orange\")\n\n\nExamine the density plot. How does it compare to the histogram? What does it tell you about the typical elevation, variability / range in elevations, and shape of the distribution of elevations within this range?\n\n12.1.12 Exercise 12: Density Plots vs Histograms\nThe histogram and density plot both allow us to visualize the behavior of a quantitative variable: typical outcome, variability / range, shape, and outliers. What are the pros/cons of each? What do you like/not like about each?\n\n12.1.13 Exercise 13: Code = communication\nWe obviously won’t be done until we talk about communication. All code above has a similar general structure (where the details can change):\n\nggplot(___, aes(x = ___)) + \n  geom___(color = \"___\", fill = \"___\") + \n  labs(x = \"___\", y = \"___\")\n\n\nThough not necessary to the code working, it’s common, good practice to indent or tab the lines of code after the first line (counterexample below). Why?\n\n\n# YUCK\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\ngeom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 200) +\nlabs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\nThough not necessary to the code working, it’s common, good practice to put a line break after each + (counterexample below). Why?\n\n\n# YUCK \nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) + geom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 200) + labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n12.1.14 Exercise 14: Practice\n\n12.1.14.1 Part a\nPractice your viz skills to learn about some of the variables in one of the following datasets from the previous class:\n\n# Data on students in this class\nsurvey &lt;- read.csv(\"https://hash-mac.github.io/stat112site-s25/data/survey.csv\")\n\n# World Cup data\nworld_cup &lt;- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-11-29/worldcups.csv\")\n\n\n12.1.14.2 Part b\nCheck out the RStudio Data Visualization cheat sheet to learn more features of ggplot.",

    "text": "13.2 New stuff\nThus far, we’ve been studying one variable at a time, using univariate plots. But once we get a sense of how individual variables behave on their own, our questions often turn to relationships among variables. For example, in our hikes data:\n\nHow much time does it take to complete a hike? ——&gt; How is time related to a hike’s elevation? What about its length?\nHow does difficult rating vary from hike to hike? ——-&gt; How is difficulty rating related to a hike’s ascent?\n\n\n13.2.1 Exploring relationships\nExploring univariate patterns often sparks follow-up questions about relationships between 2+ variables. Often, but not always, variables take on specific roles:\n\n\nresponse variable: the variable whose variability we would like to explain (time to complete a hike)\n\npredictors: variables that might explain some of the variability in the response (a hike’s elevation or length)\n\nVisualizations can help explore:\n\nrelationship trends (direction and form)\nrelationship strength (degree of variability from the trend)\n\noutliers in the relationship\n\nEXAMPLE 3\nFor each pair of variables below, sketch on paper a visualization of their relationship. Focus on general viz process, don’t worry about the exact details. The data here are totally made up.\n\n3pm temperature (response) vs 9am temperature (predictor)\n\n\ndata.frame(temp_3pm = c(24, 26, 20, 15, 15, 15), temp_9am = c(14, 18, 15, 13, 11, 11))\n\n  temp_3pm temp_9am\n1       24       14\n2       26       18\n3       20       15\n4       15       13\n5       15       11\n6       15       11\n\n\n\n3pm temperature (response) vs location (predictor)\n\n\nweather &lt;- data.frame(temp_3pm = c(24, 26, 20, 15, 15, 0, 40, 60, 57, 44, 51, 75),\n                      location = rep(c(\"A\", \"B\"), each = 6))\nweather\n\n   temp_3pm location\n1        24        A\n2        26        A\n3        20        A\n4        15        A\n5        15        A\n6         0        A\n7        40        B\n8        60        B\n9        57        B\n10       44        B\n11       51        B\n12       75        B\n\n\nThink: How might we modify the below density plot of temp_3pm to distinguish between locations?\n\nggplot(weather, aes(x = temp_3pm)) +\n      geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrain_today (the response) and location (the predictor)\n\n\nweather &lt;- data.frame(rain_today = c(\"no\", \"no\", \"no\", \"no\", \"yes\", \"no\", \"yes\", \"no\", \"yes\", \"yes\", \"no\", \"yes\"),\n                        location = c(rep(\"A\", 7), rep(\"B\", 5)))\n    weather\n\n   rain_today location\n1          no        A\n2          no        A\n3          no        A\n4          no        A\n5         yes        A\n6          no        A\n7         yes        A\n8          no        B\n9         yes        B\n10        yes        B\n11         no        B\n12        yes        B\n\n\nThink: How might we modify the below bar plot of location to distinguish between days on which it did or didn’t rain?\n\nggplot(weather, aes(x = location)) +\n      geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13.2.2 General guidance for building bivariate plots\nAs with univariate plots, an appropriate visualization for the relationship between 2 variables depends upon whether the variables are quantitative or categorical. In general:\n\nEach quantitative variable requires a new axis (or a quantitative scale if we run out of axes).\nEach categorical variable requires a new way to “group” the graphic (eg: using colors, shapes, separate facets, etc)\nFor visualizations in which overlap in glyphs or plots obscures the patterns, try faceting or transparency.",

Notice that:\n\nboth variables are quantitative, and get their own axes\nthe response variable is on the y-axis, demonstrating how repub_pct_20 might be predicted by repub_pct_16, not vice versa\n\nTry to replicate this using ggplot(). THINK:\n\nWhat info do you need to set up the canvas?\nWhat geometric layer (geom_???) might add these dots / points for each county? We haven’t learned this yet, just take some guesses.\n\n\n\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_16, y = repub_pct_20)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13.3.3 Exercise 2: 2 Quantitiative Variables\nRun each chunk below to build up a a scatterplot of repub_pct_20 vs repub_pct_16 with different glyphs representing each county. Address or think about any prompts in the comments (#).\n\n# Set up the plotting frame\n# How does this differ than the frame for our histogram of repub_pct_20 alone? It adds a y-axis.\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16))\n\n\n# Add a layer of points for each county\n# Take note of the geom!\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n# Change the shape of the points\n# What happens if you change the shape to another number? It changes the shape of the data points.\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point(shape = 3)\n\n\n# YOU TRY: Modify the code to make the points \"orange\"\n# NOTE: Try to anticipate if \"color\" or \"fill\" will be useful here. Then try both.\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"orange\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Add a layer that represents each county by the state it's in\n# Take note of the geom and the info it needs to run!\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = state_abbr))\n\n\n13.3.4 Exercise 3: Reflect\nSummarize the relationship between the Republican support in 2020 and 2016. Be sure to comment on:\n\nthe strength of the relationship (weak/moderate/strong)\n\nthe direction of the relationship (positive/negative)\n\noutliers (in what state do counties deviate from the national trend? Any ideas why this might be the case?)\n\n\nThe relationship between the Republican support in 2020 and 2016 is positive strong. Some of the TX desviate from the national trend, this could be becuase the support in 2020 increase higher than the prediction based on 2016.\n\n\n13.3.5 Exercise 4: Visualizing trend\nThe trend of the relationship between repub_pct_20 and repub_pct_16 is clearly positive and (mostly) linear. We can highlight this trend by adding a model “smooth” to the plot:\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth()\n\n\n13.3.5.1 Part a\nConstruct a new plot that contains the model smooth but does not include the individual point glyphs.\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_smooth()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13.3.5.2 Part b\nBy default, geom_smooth() adds a smooth, localized model line. To examine the “best” linear model, we can specify method = \"lm\". It’s pretty similar in this example!\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n\n13.3.6 Exercise 5: Your Turn\nTo examine how the 2020 results are related to some county demographics, construct scatterplots of repub_pct_20 vs median_rent, and repub_pct_20 vs median_age. Summarize the relationship between these two variables and comment on which is the better predictor of repub_pct_20, median_rent or median_age.\n\n# Scatterplot of repub_pct_20 vs median_rent\n\nggplot(elections, aes(x = median_rent, y = repub_pct_20)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Scatterplot of repub_pct_20 vs median_age\nggplot(elections, aes(x = median_age, y = repub_pct_20)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe relationship between republican pct in 2020 and the median rent is roughly strong and negative, which means that in average, the percentage of republican voting increased when the median rent is lower. The relationship with median age is weak, the data points are spread with a concentration in the middle age, indicating that most republican percentage of voter had around that age but do not show a clear trend. Thus, ‘median_rent’ is a better predictor of ’repub_pct_20`\n\nExercise 6: A Sad Scatterplot\nNext, let’s explore the relationship between a county’s 2020 Republican support repub_pct_20 and the historical political trends in its state. In this case repub_pct_20 is quantitative, but historical is categorical. Explain why a scatterplot might not be an effective visualization for exploring this relationship. (What questions does / doesn’t it help answer?)\n\nA scatterplot is a good visualization when both variables are quantitative. With a categorical variable would be hard if not impossible to clearly see the distribution of the data points and determine patterns among it.\n\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = historical)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13.3.7 Exercise 7: Quantitative vs Categorical – Violins & Boxes\nThough the above scatterplot did group the counties by historical category, it’s nearly impossible to pick out meaningful patterns in 2020 Republican support in each category. Let’s try adding 2 different geom layers to the frame:\n\n# Side-by-side violin plots\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = historical)) +\n  geom_violin()\n\n\n# Side-by-side boxplots (defined below)\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = historical)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\nBox plots are constructed from five numbers - the minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum value of a quantitative variable:\n\nREFLECT:\nSummarize what you’ve learned about the 2020 Republican county-level support within and between red/purple/blue states.\n\nIn the 2020, there was a greater support of Republican in historical red states and a lower in blue states.\n\n\n13.3.8 Exercise 8: Quantitative vs Categorical – Intuition Check\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe Quick\n\n\n\nDon’t spend more than 3 minutes on this!\n\n\nWe can also visualize the relationship between repub_pct_20 and historical using our familiar density plots. In the plot below, notice that we simply created a separate density plot for each historical category. (The plot itself is “bad” but we’ll fix it below.) Try to adjust the code chunk below, which starts with a density plot of repub_pct_20 alone, to re-create this image.\n\n\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 9: Quantitative vs Categorical – Density Plots\nWork through the chunks below and address the comments therein.\n\n# the colors don't alling with the name of the category\n# the density plots are on top of each other.\n\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n# The scale_fill_manual defines which colors are use in the plot\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\"))\n\n\n# Alpha = 0.5 make the fill transparent\n# The closer alpha is to 0 the more transparent and the closser is to 1, the more opaqueit is.\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\"))\n\n\n# It separates the density plots in facets for each historical group\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\")) +\n  facet_wrap(~ historical)\n\n\n# Let's try a similar grouping strategy with a histogram instead of density plot.\n# It is hard to understand and find patterns\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\"))\n\nExercise 10\nWe’ve now learned 3 (of many) ways to visualize the relationship between a quantitative and categorical variable: side-by-side violins, boxplots, and density plots.\n\n\nWhich do you like best? I like more the boxplot\n\nWhat is one pro of density plots relative to boxplots? It’s easier to compare distributions as present all the data.\n\nWhat is one con of density plots relative to boxplots? Boxplots are easier to interpret\nExercise 11: Categorical vs Categorical – Intuition Check\nFinally, let’s simply explore who won each county in 2020 (winner_20) and how this breaks down by historical voting trends in the state. That is, let’s explore the relationship between 2 categorical variables! Following the same themes as above, we can utilize grouping features such as fill/color or facets to distinguish between different categories of winner_20 and historical.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe Quick\n\n\n\nSpend at most 5 minutes on the following intuition check. Adjust the code below to recreate the following two plots.\n\n\n\n\n# Plot 1: adjust this to recreate the top plot\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Plot 2: adjust this to recreate the bottom plot\nggplot(elections, aes(x = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar()+\n  facet_wrap(~historical)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13.3.9 Exercise 12: Categorical vs Categorical\nConstruct the following 4 bar plot visualizations.\n\n# A stacked bar plot\n# historical = x-axis\n# winner_20 = fills the bars\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n# A faceted bar plot\nggplot(elections, aes(x = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  facet_wrap(~ historical)\n\n\n# A side-by-side bar plot\n# Note the new argument to geom_bar\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\")\n\n\n# A proportional bar plot\n# Note the new argument to geom_bar\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\")\n\n\n13.3.9.1 Part a\nName one pro and one con of using the “proportional bar plot” instead of one of the other three options. - Pro: easier to compare the relative outcome in blue vs purple vs red states - Con: we don’t know how many counties are part of each category.\n\n13.3.9.2 Part b\nWhat’s your favorite bar plot from part and why? - the stacked bar plot because i find it easier to understand in context of the data and identify trends\n\n13.3.10 Exercise 13: Practice (now or later)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecide\n\n\n\nDecide what’s best for you:\n\nTry this extra practice now.\nReflect on the above exercises and come back to this extra practice later (but before the next class).\n\n\n\nImport some daily weather data from a few locations in Australia:\n\nweather &lt;- read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/weather_3_locations.csv\")\n\nConstruct plots that address the research questions in each chunk. You might make multiple plots–there are many ways to do things!. However, don’t just throw spaghetti at the wall.\nReflect before doing anything. What types of variables are these? How might you plot just 1 of the variables, and then tweak the plot to incorporate the other?\n\n# How do 3pm temperatures (temp3pm) differ by location?\nggplot(weather, aes(x = temp3pm, fill = location)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# How might we predict the 3pm temperature (temp3pm) by the 9am temperature (temp9am)?\nggplot(weather, aes(x = temp9am, y = temp3pm)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# How do the number of rainy days (raintoday) differ by location?\nggplot(weather, aes(x = location, fill = raintoday)) +\n  geom_bar()",

    "text": "13.4 Exercises (optional)\nThe above visualizations are foundational and important. But they’re not the only way to visualize the variables in our dataset.\nOptional Exercise 1: Many Categories\nSuppose we wanted to better understand how the 2020 Republican support varied from county to county within each state. Since repub_pct_20 is quantitative and state_abbr is categorical, we could make a density plot of repub_pct_20 for each state. Reflect on why this is bad.\n\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = state_abbr)) + \n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA facet wrap would also be bad!\n\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20)) + \n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) + \n  facet_wrap(~ state_abbr)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we want to compare the distribution of some quantitative outcome among many groups / categories, a ridgeline plot can be a good option. These are also called joy plots, named after the album cover for “Unknown Pleasures” by Joy Division. (Look it up!) To make a ridgeline plot, we can use the geom_density_ridges() function from the ggridges package.\n\n# Install ggridges package\nlibrary(ggridges)\n\n# Make our first joy plot\n# THINK: What DON'T you like about this?\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, y = state_abbr)) + \n  geom_density_ridges()\n\n\n# Let's put the states in order by Republican support, not alphabet\n# How do you think fct_reorder works? We'll learn about this later in the semester.\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, y = fct_reorder(state_abbr, repub_pct_20))) + \n  geom_density_ridges(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n# YOUR TURN: color/fill the ridges according to a state's historical voting patterns \n# and add meaningful axis labels\n\nFollow-up questions\n\nWhich states tend to have the most variability in outcomes from county to county? The least?\nWhat other interesting patterns do you notice?\nDoes this plot prompt any other questions?\nOptional Exercise 2: Total Outcomes by State\nLet’s import some new data and counts up the total votes (Republican and Democratic) by state, not county. This was wrangled from the elections data!\n\nelections_by_state &lt;- read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/election_2020_by_state.csv\")\n\nFor example, we might make a scatterplot of the 2020 vs 2016 outcomes:\n\nggplot(elections_by_state, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) + \n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBUT this isn’t the easiest way to communicate or identify the changes from 1 year to the next.\n\n# YOU TRY\n# Start by creating a \"scatterplot\" of state_abbr (y-axis) by 2020 Republican support on the x-axis\n# Color the points red\n# Scroll to solutions below when you're ready\n\n\n# Check it out\nggplot(elections_by_state, aes(x = repub_pct_20, y = state_abbr)) + \n  geom_point(color = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# YOU TRY\n# Reorder the states in terms of their 2020 Republican support (not alphabet)\n# Scroll to solutions below when you're ready\n\n\n# Check it out\nggplot(elections_by_state, aes(x = repub_pct_20, y = fct_reorder(state_abbr, repub_pct_20))) + \n  geom_point(color = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Finally, add ANOTHER layer of points for the 2016 outcomes\n# What info does this new geom_point() layer need to run?\nggplot(elections_by_state, aes(x = repub_pct_20, y = fct_reorder(state_abbr, repub_pct_20))) + \n  geom_point(color = \"red\") + \n  geom_point(aes(x = repub_pct_16, y = state_abbr))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflect on the following\n\nWhat do you think this plot needs? Try it! You might need to do some digging online.\nSummarize the main takeaways from the plots. Which states changed the most from 2016 to 2020? The least? Where did the Republican support increase? Where did it decrease?\nWhat other questions are you left with?",

There, they range from ~10 to ~45 with a typical temp around ~30 degrees.\nTemperatures tend to be lowest in Hobart. There, they range from ~5 to ~45 with a typical temp around ~15 degrees.\nWollongong temps are in between and are the least variable from day to day.\n\nSUBTLETIES: Defining fill or color by a variable\nHow we define the fill or color depends upon whether we’re defining it by a named color or by some variable in our dataset. For example:\n\ngeom___(fill = \"blue\")named colors are defined outside the aesthetics and put in quotes\ngeom___(aes(fill = variable)) or ggplot(___, aes(fill = variable))\ncolors/fills defined by a variable are defined inside the aesthetics\nExample 3\nLet’s consider Wollongong alone:\n\n# Don't worry about the syntax (we'll learn it soon)\nwoll &lt;- weather |&gt;\n  filter(location == \"Wollongong\") |&gt; \n  mutate(date = as.Date(date))  \n\n\n# How often does it raintoday?\n# Fill your geometric layer with the color blue.\nggplot(woll, aes(x = raintoday)) +\n  geom_bar(fill = \"blue\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# If it does raintoday, what does this tell us about raintomorrow?\n# Use your intuition first\nggplot(woll, aes(x = raintoday, fill = raintomorrow)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Now compare different approaches\n\n# Default: stacked bars\nggplot(woll, aes(x = raintoday, fill = raintomorrow)) + \n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Side-by-side bars\nggplot(woll, aes(x = raintoday, fill = raintomorrow)) + \n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Proportional bars\n# position = \"fill\" refers to filling the frame, nothing to do with the color-related fill\nggplot(woll, aes(x = raintoday, fill = raintomorrow)) + \n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflection\nThere’s often not one “best plot”, but a combination of plots that provide a complete picture:\n\nThe stacked and side-by-side bars reflect that on most days, it does not rain.\nThe proportional / filled bars lose that information, but make it easier to compare proportions: it’s more likely to rain tomorrow if it also rains today.\nExample 4\nConstruct a plot that illustrates how 3pm temperatures (temp3pm) vary by date in Wollongong. Represent each day on the plot and use a curve/line to help highlight the trends.\n\n# THINK: What variable goes on the y-axis?\n# For the curve, try adding span = 0.5 to tweak the curvature\nggplot(woll, aes(x = date, y = temp3pm))+\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_smooth (span = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Instead of a curve that captures the general TREND,\n# draw a line that illustrates the movement of RAW temperatures from day to day\n# NOTE: We haven't learned this geom yet! Guess.\nggplot(woll, aes(y = temp3pm, x = date)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_line(color = \"skyblue\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: A line plot isn’t always appropriate! It can be useful in situations like this, when our data are chronological.\nReflection\nThere’s a seasonal / cyclic behavior in temperatures – they’re highest in January (around 23 degrees) and lowest in July (around 16 degrees). There are also some outliers – some abnormally hot and cold days.",

The addition of location adds a 3rd variable into our research questions:\n\nHow does the relationship between raintoday and raintomorrow vary by location?\nHow does the behavior of temp3pm over date vary by location?\nAnd so on.\n\nThus far, we’ve focused on the following components of a plot:\n\nsetting up a frame\n\nadding layers / geometric elements\nsplitting the plot into facets for different groups / categories\nchange the theme, e.g. axis labels, color, fill\n\nWe’ll have to think about all of this, along with scales. Scales change the color, fill, size, shape, or other properties according to the levels of a new variable. This is different than just assigning scale by, for example, color = \"blue\".\nWork on the examples below in your groups. Check in with your intuition! We’ll then discuss as a group as relevant.\nExample 5\n\n# Plot temp3pm vs temp9am\n# Change the code in order to indicate the location to which each data point corresponds\nggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am, color = location)) + \n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Change the code in order to indicate the location to which each data point corresponds\n# AND identify the days on which it rained / didn't raintoday\nggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am, color = location)) + \n  geom_point() +\n  facet_wrap(~raintoday)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# How many ways can you think to make that plot of temp3pm vs temp9am with info about location and rain?\n# Play around!\n\nggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am, color = location, shape = raintoday)) + \n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 6\n\n# Change the code in order to construct a line plot of temp3pm vs date for each separate location (no points!)\nggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = date, color = location, group = location)) + \n  geom_line(linewidth = 0.5) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 7\n\n# Plot the relationship of raintomorrow & raintoday\n# Change the code in order to indicate this relationship by location\nggplot(weather, aes(x = raintoday, fill = raintomorrow)) + \n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\") +\n  facet_wrap(~location)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Not Get Overwhelmed?\n\n\n\nThere’s no end to the number and type of visualizations you could make. And it’s important to not just throw spaghetti at the wall until something sticks. FlowingData shows that one dataset can be visualized many ways, and makes good recommendations for data viz workflow, which we modify and build upon here:\n\nIdentify simple research questions.\nWhat do you want to understand about the variables or the relationships among them?\n\nStart with the basics and work incrementally.\n\nIdentify what variables you want to include in your plot and what structure these have (eg: categorical, quantitative, dates)\nStart simply. Build a plot of just 1 of these variables, or the relationship between 2 of these variables.\nSet up a plotting frame and add just one geometric layer at a time.\nStart tweaking: add whatever new variables you want to examine,\n\n\n\nAsk your plot questions.\n\nWhat questions does your plot answer? What questions are left unanswered by your plot?\nWhat new questions does your plot spark / inspire?\nDo you have the viz tools to answer these questions, or might you learn more?\n\n\nFocus.\nReporting a large number of visualizations can overwhelm the audience and obscure your conclusions. Instead, pick out a focused yet comprehensive set of visualizations.",

    "text": "14.3 Exercises (required)\nThe story\nThough far from a perfect assessment of academic preparedness, SAT scores have historically been used as one measurement of a state’s education system. The education dataset contains various education variables for each state:\n\n# Import and check out data\neducation &lt;- read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/sat.csv\")\nhead(education)\n\n       State expend ratio salary frac verbal math  sat  fracCat\n1    Alabama  4.405  17.2 31.144    8    491  538 1029   (0,15]\n2     Alaska  8.963  17.6 47.951   47    445  489  934 (45,100]\n3    Arizona  4.778  19.3 32.175   27    448  496  944  (15,45]\n4   Arkansas  4.459  17.1 28.934    6    482  523 1005   (0,15]\n5 California  4.992  24.0 41.078   45    417  485  902  (15,45]\n6   Colorado  5.443  18.4 34.571   29    462  518  980  (15,45]\n\n\nA codebook is provided by Danny Kaplan who also made these data accessible:\n\nExercise 1: SAT scores\nPart a\nConstruct a plot of how the average sat scores vary from state to state. (Just use 1 variable – sat not State!)\n\nggplot(education, aes(x = sat)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nSummarize your observations from the plot. Comment on the basics: range, typical outcomes, shape. (Any theories about what might explain this non-normal shape?)\n\nThe range seems to be from around 800 to 1100. The higher point is around 900 and then there is a decrease in bell shape form, this is the typical outcome. There is a second bell shaped curve between 1000 and 1100, therefore is bi-modal. This shape could be explained by the spending per pupil invested.\n\nExercise 2: SAT Scores vs Per Pupil Spending & SAT Scores vs Salaries\nThe first question we’d like to answer is: Can the variability in sat scores from state to state be partially explained by how much a state spends on education, specifically its per pupil spending (expend) and typical teacher salary?\nPart a\n\n# Construct a plot of sat vs expend\n# Include a \"best fit linear regression model\" (HINT: method = \"lm\")\nggplot(education, aes(y = sat, x = expend)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Construct a plot of sat vs salary\n# Include a \"best fit linear regression model\" (HINT: method = \"lm\")\nggplot(education, aes(y = sat, x = salary)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nWhat are the relationship trends between SAT scores and spending? Is there anything that surprises you?\nExercise 3: SAT Scores vs Per Pupil Spending and Teacher Salaries\nConstruct one visualization of the relationship of sat with salary and expend. HINT: Start with just 2 variables and tweak that code to add the third variable. Try out a few things!\n\nggplot(education, aes(y = sat, x = salary, color = expend)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4: Another way to Incorporate Scale\nIt can be tough to distinguish color scales and size scales for quantitative variables. Another option is to discretize a quantitative variable, or basically cut it up into categories.\nConstruct the plot below. Check out the code and think about what’s happening here. What happens if you change “2” to “3”?\n\nggplot(education, aes(y = sat, x = salary, color = cut(expend, 4))) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = \"lm\")\n\nDescribe the trivariate relationship between sat, salary, and expend.\n\nStates with lower expend per pupil and teacher’s salary seems to have a better perfomance in the SAT.\n\nExercise 5: Finally an Explanation\nIt’s strange that SAT scores seem to decrease with spending. But we’re leaving out an important variable from our analysis: the fraction of a state’s students that actually take the SAT. The fracCat variable indicates this fraction: low (under 15% take the SAT), medium (15-45% take the SAT), and high (at least 45% take the SAT).\nPart a\nBuild a univariate viz of fracCat to better understand how many states fall into each category.\n\nggplot(education, aes(x = fracCat)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nBuild 2 bivariate visualizations that demonstrate the relationship between sat and fracCat. What story does your graphic tell and why does this make contextual sense?\n\nggplot(education, aes(x = sat, fill = fracCat)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart c\nMake a trivariate visualization that demonstrates the relationship of sat with expend AND fracCat. Highlight the differences in fracCat groups through color AND unique trend lines. What story does your graphic tell?\nDoes it still seem that SAT scores decrease as spending increases?\n\nggplot(education, aes(y = sat, x = expend, color = fracCat)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  theme_minimal()\n\nList of 136\n $ line                            :List of 6\n  ..$ colour       : chr \"black\"\n  ..$ linewidth    : num 0.5\n  ..$

    "text": "14.4 Exercises (optional)\nExercise 6: Heat Maps\nAs usual, we’ve only just scratched the surface! There are lots of other data viz techniques for exploring multivariate relationships. Let’s start with a heat map.\nPart a\nRun the chunks below. Check out the code, but don’t worry about every little detail! NOTES:\n\nThis is not part of the ggplot() grammar, making it a bit complicated.\nIf you’re curious about what a line in the plot does, comment it out (#) and check out what happens!\nIn the plot, for each state (row), each variable (column) is scaled to indicate whether the state has a relative high value (yellow), a relatively low value (purple), or something in between (blues/greens).\nYou can also play with the color scheme. Type ?cm.colors in the console to learn about various options.\nWe’ll improve the plot later, so don’t spend too much time trying to learn something from this plot.\n\n\n# Remove the \"State\" column and use it to label the rows\n# Then scale the variables\nplot_data &lt;- education |&gt; \n  column_to_rownames(\"State\") |&gt; \n  data.matrix() |&gt; \n  scale()\n\n# Load the gplots package needed for heatmaps\nlibrary(gplots)\n\n# Construct heatmap 1\nheatmap.2(plot_data,\n  dendrogram = \"none\",\n  Rowv = NA, \n  scale = \"column\",\n  keysize = 0.7, \n  density.info = \"none\",\n  col = hcl.colors(256), \n  margins = c(10, 20),\n  colsep = c(1:7), rowsep = (1:50), sepwidth = c(0.05, 0.05),\n  sepcolor = \"white\", trace = \"none\"\n)\n\n\n# Construct heatmap 2\nheatmap.2(plot_data,\n  dendrogram = \"none\",\n  Rowv = TRUE,             ### WE CHANGED THIS FROM NA TO TRUE\n  scale = \"column\",\n  keysize = 0.7, \n  density.info = \"none\",\n  col = hcl.colors(256), \n  margins = c(10, 20),\n  colsep = c(1:7), rowsep = (1:50), sepwidth = c(0.05, 0.05),\n  sepcolor = \"white\", trace = \"none\"\n)\n\n\n# Construct heatmap 3\nheatmap.2(plot_data,\n  dendrogram = \"row\",       ### WE CHANGED THIS FROM \"none\" TO \"row\"\n  Rowv = TRUE,            \n  scale = \"column\",\n  keysize = 0.7, \n  density.info = \"none\",\n  col = hcl.colors(256), \n  margins = c(10, 20),\n  colsep = c(1:7), rowsep = (1:50), sepwidth = c(0.05, 0.05),\n  sepcolor = \"white\", trace = \"none\"\n)\n\nPart b\nIn the final two plots, the states (rows) are rearranged by similarity with respect to these education metrics. The final plot includes a dendrogram which further indicates clusters of similar states. In short, states that have a shorter path to connection are more similar than others.\nPutting this all together, what insight do you gain about the education trends across U.S. states? Which states are similar? In what ways are they similar? Are there any outliers with respect to 1 or more of the education metrics?\nExercise 7: Star plots\nLike heat maps, star plots indicate the relative scale of each variable for each state. Thus, we can use star maps to identify similar groups of states, and unusual states!\nPart a\nConstruct and check out the star plot below. Note that each state has a “pie”, with each segment corresponding to a different variable. The larger a segment, the larger that variable’s value is in that state.

    "text": "15.4 Exercises\n\n15.4.1 Preview\nYou’ll explore some R spatial viz tools below. In general, there are two important pieces to every map:\nPiece 1: A dataset\nThis dataset must include either:\n\nlocation coordinates for your points of interest (for point maps); or\nvariable outcomes for your regions of interest (for choropleth maps)\n\n\nPiece 2: A background map\nWe need latitude and longitude coordinates to specify the boundaries for your regions of interest (eg: countries, states). This is where it gets really sticky!\n\nCounty-level, state-level, country-level, continent-level info live in multiple places.\nWhere we grab this info can depend upon whether we want to make a point map or a choropleth map. (The background maps can be used somewhat interchangeably, but it requires extra code :/)\nWhere we grab this info can also depend upon the structure of our data and how much data wrangling / cleaning we’re up for. For choropleth maps, the labels of regions in our data must match those in the background map. For example, if our data labels states with their abbreviations (eg: MN) and the background map refers to them as full names in lower case (eg: minnesota), we have to wrangle our data so that it matches the background map.\n\nIn short, the code for spatial viz gets very specialized. The goal of these exercises is to:\n\nplay around and experience the wide variety of spatial viz tools out there\nunderstand the difference between point maps and choropleth maps\nhave fun\n\nYou can skip around as you wish and it’s totally fine if you don’t finish everything. Just come back at some point to play around.\nPart 1: Interactive points on a map with leaflet\n\nLeaflet is an open-source JavaScript library for creating maps. We can use it inside R through the leaflet package.\nThis uses a different plotting framework than ggplot2, but still has a tidyverse feel (which will become more clear as we learn other tidyverse tools!).\nThe general steps are as follows:\n\nCreate a map widget by calling leaflet() and telling it the data to use.\nAdd a base map using addTiles() (the default) or addProviderTiles().\nAdd layers to the map using layer functions (e.g. addMarkers(), addPolygons()).\nPrint the map widget to display it.\nExercise 1: A leaflet with markers / points\nEarlier this semester, I asked for the latitude and longitude of one of your favorite places. I rounded these to the nearest whole number, so that they’re near to but not exactly at those places. Let’s load the data and map it!\n\nfave_places &lt;- read.csv(\"https://ajohns24.github.io/data/112/our_fave_places.csv\")\n\n# Check it out\nhead(fave_places)\n\n  latitude longitude\n1       46      -123\n2       33        52\n3       48       -90\n4       36      -112\n5       59        25\n6       39      -106\n\n\nPart a\nYou can use a “two-finger scroll” to zoom in and out.\n\n# Load the leaflet package\nlibrary(leaflet)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Just a plotting frame\nleaflet(data = fave_places)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Now what do we have?\nleaflet(data = fave_places) |&gt; \n  addTiles()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Now what do we have?\n# longitude and latitude refer to the variables in our data\nleaflet(data = fave_places) |&gt; \n  addTiles() |&gt; \n  addMarkers(lng = ~longitude, lat = ~latitude)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Since we named them \"longitude\" and \"latitude\", the function\n# automatically recognizes these variables. No need to write them!\nleaflet(data = fave_places) |&gt; \n  addTiles() |&gt; \n  addMarkers()\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nPLAY AROUND! This map is interactive. Zoom in on one location. Keep zooming – what level of detail can you get into? How does that detail depend upon where you try to zoom in (thus what are the limitations of this tool)?\nExercise 2: Details\nWe can change all sorts of details in leaflet maps.\n\n# Load package needed to change color\nlibrary(gplots)\n\n# We can add colored circles instead of markers at each location\nleaflet(data = fave_places) |&gt; \n  addTiles() |&gt; \n  addCircles(color = col2hex(\"red\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# We can change the background\n# Mark locations with yellow dots\n# And connect the dots, in their order in the dataset, with green lines\n# (These green lines don't mean anything here, but would if this were somebody's travel path!)\nleaflet(data = fave_places) |&gt;\n  addProviderTiles(\"USGS\") |&gt;\n  addCircles(weight = 10, opacity = 1, color = col2hex(\"yellow\")) |&gt;\n  addPolylines(\n    lng = ~longitude,\n    lat = ~latitude,\n    color = col2hex(\"green\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nIn general:\n\naddProviderTiles() changes the base map.\nTo explore all available provider base maps, type providers in the console. (Though some don’t work :/)\n\nUse addMarkers() or addCircles() to mark locations. Type ?addControl into the console to pull up a help file which summarizes the aesthetics of these markers and how you can change them. For example:\n\n\nweight = how thick to make the lines, points, pixels\n\nopacity = transparency (like alpha in ggplot2)\ncolors need to be in “hex” form. We used the col2hex() function from the gplots library to do that\n\n\nExercise 3: Your turn\nThe starbucks data, compiled by Danny Kaplan, contains information about every Starbucks in the world at the time the data were collected, including Latitude and Longitude:\n\n# Import starbucks location data\nstarbucks &lt;- read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/starbucks.csv\")\n\nLet’s focus on only those in Minnesota for now:\n\n# Don't worry about the syntax\nstarbucks_mn &lt;- starbucks |&gt;   \n  filter(Country == \"US\", State.Province == \"MN\")\n\nCreate a leaflet map of the Starbucks locations in Minnesota. Keep it simple – go back to Exercise 1 for an example.\n\nleaflet(data = starbucks_mn) |&gt; \n  addTiles() |&gt; \n  addMarkers()\n\n\n\n\n\nPart 2: Static points on a map\nLeaflet is very powerful and fun. But:\n\nIt’s not great when we have lots of points to map – it takes lots of time.\nIt makes good interactive maps, but we often need a static map (eg: we can not print interactive maps!).\n\nLet’s explore how to make point maps with ggplot(), not leaflet().\nExercise 3: A simple scatterplot\nLet’s start with the ggplot() tools we already know. Construct a scatterplot of all starbucks locations, not just those in Minnesota, with:\n\nLatitude and Longitude coordinates (which goes on the y-axis?!)\nMake the points transparent (alpha = 0.2) and smaller (size = 0.2)\n\nIt’s pretty cool that the plots we already know can provide some spatial context. But what don’t you like about this plot?\n\nggplot(starbucks, aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude )) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.2, size = 0.2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4: Adding a country-level background\nLet’s add a background map of country-level boundaries.\nPart a\nFirst, we can grab country-level boundaries from the rnaturalearth package.\n\n# Load the package\nlibrary(rnaturalearth)\n\n# Get info about country boundaries across the world\n# in a \"sf\" or simple feature format\nworld_boundaries &lt;- ne_countries(returnclass = \"sf\")\n\nIn your console, type world_boundaries to check out what’s stored there. Don’t print it our in your Rmd – printing it would be really messy there (even just the head()).\nPart b\nRun the chunks below to build up a new map.\n\n# A world map\n# we are using geom sf\nggplot(world_boundaries) + \n  geom_sf()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Load package needed to change map theme\nlibrary(mosaic)\n\n# Add a point for each Starbucks\n# NOTE: The Starbucks info is in our starbucks data, not world_boundaries\n# We need to indicate the data set we are using in the geom_point\nggplot(world_boundaries) + \n  geom_sf() + \n  geom_point(\n    data = starbucks,\n    aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude),\n    alpha = 0.3, size = 0.2, color = \"darkgreen\"\n  ) +\n  theme_map()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart c\nWe learn the locations of starbucks around the world at the time the data set was recorded. It is more common in North America, Europe and east Asia.\nExercise 5: Zooming in on some countries\nInstead of world_boundaries &lt;- ne_countries(returnclass = 'sf') we could zoom in on…\n\nthe continent of Africa: ne_countries(continent = 'Africa', returnclass = 'sf')\n\na set of countries: ne_countries(country = c('france', 'united kingdom', 'germany'), returnclass = 'sf')\n\nboundaries within a country: ne_states(country = 'united states of america', returnclass = 'sf')\n\n\nOur goal here will be to map the Starbucks locations in Canada, Mexico, and the US.\nPart a\nTo make this map, we again need two pieces of information.\n\nData on Starbucks for only Canada, Mexico, and the US, labeled as “CA”, “MX”, “US” in the starbucks data.\n\n\n# We'll learn this syntax soon! Don't worry about it now.\nstarbucks_cma &lt;- starbucks |&gt; \n  filter(Country %in% c('CA', 'MX', 'US'))\n\n\nA background map of state- and national-level boundaries in Canada, Mexico, and the US. This requires ne_states() in the rnaturalearth package where the countries are labeled ‘canada’, ‘mexico’, ‘united states of america’.\n\n\ncma_boundaries &lt;- ne_states(\n  country = c(\"canada\", \"mexico\", \"united states of america\"),\n  returnclass = \"sf\")\n\nPart b\nMake the map!\n\n# Just the boundaries\nggplot(cma_boundaries) + \n  geom_sf()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Add the points\n# And zoom in\nggplot(cma_boundaries) + \n  geom_sf() + \n  geom_point(\n    data = starbucks_cma,\n    aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude),\n    alpha = 0.3,\n    size = 0.2,\n    color = \"darkgreen\"\n  ) +\n  coord_sf(xlim = c(-179.14, -50)) +\n  theme_map()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 6: A state and county-level map\nLet’s get an even higher resolution map of Starbucks locations within the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, North Dakota, and South Dakota, with a background map at the county-level.\nPart a\nTo make this map, we again need two pieces of information.\n\nData on Starbucks for only the states of interest.\n\n\nstarbucks_midwest &lt;- starbucks |&gt; \n  filter(State.Province %in% c(\"MN\", \"ND\", \"SD\", \"WI\"))\n\n\nA background map of state- and county-level boundaries in these states. This requires st_as_sf() in the sf package, and map() in the maps package, where the countries are labeled ‘minnesota’, ‘north dakota’, etc.\n\n\n# Load packages\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(maps)\n\n# Get the boundaries\nmidwest_boundaries &lt;- st_as_sf(\n  maps::map(\"county\",\n            region = c(\"minnesota\", \"wisconsin\", \"north dakota\", \"south dakota\"), \n            fill = TRUE, plot = FALSE))\n\n# Check it out\nhead(midwest_boundaries)\n\nSimple feature collection with 6 features and 1 field\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -96.81268 ymin: 45.05167 xmax: -93.01397 ymax: 48.53526\nGeodetic CRS:  +proj=longlat +ellps=clrk66 +no_defs +type=crs\n                                     ID                           geom\nminnesota,aitkin       minnesota,aitkin MULTIPOLYGON (((-93.03689 4...\nminnesota,anoka         minnesota,anoka MULTIPOLYGON (((-93.51817 4...\nminnesota,becker       minnesota,becker MULTIPOLYGON (((-95.14537 4...\nminnesota,beltrami   minnesota,beltrami MULTIPOLYGON (((-95.58655 4...\nminnesota,benton       minnesota,benton MULTIPOLYGON (((-93.77027 4...\nminnesota,big stone minnesota,big stone MULTIPOLYGON (((-96.10794 4...\n\n\nPart b\nAdjust the code below to make the plot! Remove the # to run it.\n\nggplot(midwest_boundaries) + \n   geom_sf() + \n   geom_point(\n     data = starbucks_midwest,\n     aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude),\n     alpha = 0.7,\n     size = 0.2, \n     color = 'darkgreen'\n   ) + \n   theme_map()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 7: Contour maps\nEspecially when there are lots of point locations, and those locations start overlapping on a map, it can be tough to visualize areas of higher density. Consider the Starbucks locations in Canada, Mexico, and the US that we mapped earlier:\n\n# Point map (we made this earlier)\nggplot(cma_boundaries) + \n  geom_sf() + \n  geom_point(\n    data = starbucks_cma,\n    aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude),\n    alpha = 0.3,\n    size = 0.2,\n    color = \"darkgreen\"\n  ) +\n  coord_sf(xlim = c(-179.14, -50), ylim = c(14.54, 83.11)) +\n  theme_map()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow check out the contour map.\n\n# There is not data points but regional density\n# We change the geom from point to density 2d\nggplot(cma_boundaries) + \n  geom_sf() + \n  geom_density_2d(\n    data = starbucks_cma,\n    aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude),\n    size = 0.2,\n    color = \"darkgreen\"\n  ) +\n  coord_sf(xlim = c(-179.14, -50), ylim = c(14.54, 83.11)) +\n  theme_map()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart 3: Choropleth maps\nSpatial data isn’t always in the form of point locations! For example, recall the state and county-level data on presidential elections.\n\nelections_by_state &lt;-  read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/election_2020_by_state.csv\")\nelections_by_counties &lt;- read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/election_2020_county.csv\")\n\nIn these datasets, we’re interested in the overall election outcome by region (state or county), not the specific geographic location of some observation. Let’s wrangle our data first. We’ll focus on just a few variables of interest, and create a new variable (repub_20_categories) that discretizes the repub_pct_20 variable into increments of 5 percentage points (for states) or 10 percentage points (for counties):\n\n# Don't worry about the code!\n\nelections_by_state &lt;- elections_by_state |&gt; \n  filter(state_abbr != \"DC\") |&gt; \n  select(state_name, state_abbr, repub_pct_20) |&gt; \n  mutate(repub_20_categories = \n           cut(repub_pct_20, \n               breaks = seq(30, 70, by = 5), \n               labels = c(\"30-34\", \"35-39\", \"40-44\", \"45-49\",\n                          \"50-54\", \"55-59\", \"60-64\", \"65-70\"), \n               include.lowest = TRUE))\n\nelections_by_counties &lt;- elections_by_counties |&gt; \n  select(state_name, state_abbr, county_name, county_fips,\n          repub_pct_20, median_age, median_rent) |&gt; \n  mutate(repub_20_categories = \n           cut(repub_pct_20, \n               breaks = seq(0, 100, by = 10),\n               labels = c(\"0-9\", \"10-19\", \"20-29\", \"30-39\", \"40-49\",\n                          \"50-59\", \"60-69\", \"70-79\", \"80-89\", \"90-100\"),\n               include.lowest = TRUE))\n\nExercise 8: State-level choropleth maps\nLet’s map the 2020 Republican support in each state, repub_pct_20.\nPart a\nWe again need two pieces of information.\n\nData on elections in each state, which we already have: elections_by_state.\nA background map of state boundaries in the US. The boundaries we used for point maps don’t work here. (Optional detail: they’re sf objects and we now need a data.frame object.)

The topic of effective viz is too big and nuanced to boil down into a simple list. Here are some basics:\nProfessionalism\nOnce you’re ready to “share out” your viz, it should have…\n\nmeaningful axis labels\na figure caption (depending upon where the viz will appear)\nAccessibility\nOnce you’re ready to “share out” your viz, it should…\n\nhave “alt text”, a written description of the viz that can be read out by a screen reader (video)\nuse a color palette that is distinguishable across common forms of color blindness\nDesign Details\nIn designing your viz, think about comparison. Good viz make it easy for people to perceive things that are similar and things that are different.\nEthics\nMichael Correll of Tableau Research (pdf) wrote “Data visualizations have a potentially enormous influence on how data are used to make decisions across all areas of human endeavor.” Thus ethics are critical from the data we use, to the plots we build, to the way in which we communicate this work. This is a very broad topic, and we’ll focus here on data visualization alone. Relatedly, and at a minimum:\n\nData viz should not mislead, i.e. “wrong” viz are unethical.**\nYet ethics in data viz goes much deeper. Correll describes three related principles to strive for:\n\nVisibility\nMake the invisible visible. Visualize hidden labor, hidden uncertainty, hidden impacts. Credit your sources, data and otherwise.\nPrivacy\nCollect data with empathy. Encourage small Data, anthropomorphize data, obfuscate data to protect privacy.\nPower\nChallenge structures of power. Support data due process, act as data advocates, pressure unethical analytical behavior.\n\n\nTo this list, Data Feminism authors Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein added:\n\nEmotion & Embodiment\nValue multiple forms of knowledge, including the knowledge that comes from people as living, feeling bodies in the world.\nPluralism\nThe most complete knowledge comes from synthesizing multiple perspectives\nContext\nData are not neutral or objective",

    "text": "16.2 Exercises\nExercise 1: Professionalism\nLet’s examine weather in 3 Australian locations.\n\n# Load tidyverse package for plotting and wrangling\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Import the data\nweather &lt;- read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/weather_3_locations.csv\") |&gt; \n  mutate(date = as.Date(date))\n\nThe following plot is fine for things like homework or just playing around. But we’ll make it more “professional” looking below.\n\nggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am, color = location)) + \n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart a\nReplace A, B, C, and D in the code below to:\n\nAdd a short, but descriptive title. Under 10 words.\nChange the x- and y-axis labels, currently just the names of the variables in the dataset. These should be short and include units.\nChange the legend title to “Location” (just for practice, not because it’s better than “location”).\n\n\nggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am, color = location)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  labs(x = \"Temperature recorded at 9 am in Celsius\", y = \"Temperature recorded at 3 pm in Celsius\", title = \"Correlation of morning and afternoon temperature in Australia\", color = \"City\")  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nWhen we’re including our plot in an article, paper, book, or other similar outlet, we should (and are expected to) provide a more descriptive figure caption. Typically, this is instead of a title and is more descriptive of what exactly is being plotted.\n\nAdd a figure caption in the top of the chunk.\nInclude your x-axis, y-axis, and legend labels from Part a.\nRender your Rmd and check out how the figure caption appears.\n\n\n\n\n\nScatterplot of the relation between the 9 am and the 3 pm temperature in 3 cities in Australia\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2: Accessibility\nLet’s now make a graphic more accessible.\n\nggplot(weather, aes(x = temp3pm, fill = location)) + \n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) + \n  labs(x = \"3pm temperature (Celsius)\")  \n\n\n\nDensity plots of 3pm temperatures in 3 Australian locations.\n\n\n\nPart a\nLet’s add some alt text that can be picked up by screen readers. This is a great resource on writing alt text for data viz. In short, whereas figure captions are quick descriptions which assume that the viz is accessible, alt text is a longer description which assumes the viz is not accessible. Alt text should concisely articulate:\n\nWhat your visualization is (e.g. a density plot of 3pm temperatures in Hobart, Uluru, and Wollongong, Australia).\nA 1-sentence description of the most important takeaway.\nA link to your data source if it’s not already in the caption.\n\nAdd appropriate alt text at the top of the chunk, in fig-alt. Then render your qmd, and hover over the image in your rendered html file to check out the alt text.\n\nggplot(weather, aes(x = temp3pm, fill = location)) + \n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) + \n  labs(x = \"3pm temperature (Celsius)\")  \n\n\n\nDensity plots of 3pm temperatures in 3 Australian locations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDensity plots of 3pm temperatures in 3 Australian locations.\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nColor is another important accessibility consideration. Let’s check out the color accessibility of our density plot.\n\nRun the ggplot() code from Part a in your console. The viz will pop up in the Plots tab.\nIn the Plots tab, click “Export” then “Save as image”. Save the image somewhere.\nNavigate to https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/\n\nAbove the image of crayons (I think it’s crayons?), click “Choose file” and choose the plot file you just saved.\nClick the various simulator buttons (eg: Red-Weak/Protanomaly) to check out how the colors in this plot might appear to others.\nSummarize what you learn. What impact might our color choices have on one’s ability to interpret the viz?\nPart c\nWe can change our color schemes! There are many color-blind friendly palettes in R. In the future, we’ll set a default, more color-blind friendly color theme at the top of our Rmds. We can also do this individually for any plot that uses color. Run the chunks below to explore various options.\n\nggplot(weather, aes(x = temp3pm, fill = location)) + \n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) + \n  labs(x = \"3pm temperature (Celsius)\") + \n  scale_fill_viridis_d()    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# In the color scale line:\n# Change \"fill\" to \"color\" since we use color in the aes()\n# Change \"d\" (discrete) to \"c\" (continuous) since maxtemp is on a continuous scale\nggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am, color = maxtemp)) + \n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + \n  labs(x = \"3pm temperature (Celsius)\") + \n  scale_color_viridis_c()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3: Ethics\nLet’s scratch the surface of ethics in data viz. Central to this discussion is the consideration of impact.\nPart a\nAt a minimum, our data viz should not mislead. Reconsider the climate change example from above. Why is this plot unethical and what impact might it have on policy, public opinion, etc?\n\nPart b\nAgain, data viz ethical considerations go beyond whether or not a plot is misleading. As described in the warm-up, we need to consider: visibility, privacy, power, emotion & embodiment, pluralism, & context. Depending upon the audience and goals of a data viz, addressing these points might require more nuance. Mainly, the viz tools we’ve learned are a great base or foundation, but aren’t the only approaches to data viz. \nPick one or more of the following examples of data viz to discuss with your group. How do the approaches taken:\n\nemphasize one or more of: visibility, privacy, power, emotion, embodiment, pluralism, and/or context?\nimprove upon what we might be able to convey with a simpler bar chart, scatterplot, etc?\n\n\nExample: W.E.B. Du Bois (1868–1963)\nDu Bois (“Doo Boys”) was a “sociologist, socialist, historian, civil rights activist, Pan-Africanist, author, writer, and editor”1. He was also a pioneer in elevating emotion and embodiment in data visualization. For the Paris World Fair of 1900, Du Bois and his team of students from Atlanta University presented 60 data visualizations of the Black experience in America, less than 50 years after the abolishment of slavery. Du Bois noted: “I wanted to set down its aim and method in some outstanding way which would bring my work to notice by the thinking world.” That is, he wanted to increase the impact of his work by partnering technical visualizations with design that better connects to lived experiences. NOTE: This work uses language common to that time period and addresses the topic of slavery. Check out:\n\nA complete set of the data visualizations provided by Anthony Starks (@ajstarks).\nAn article by Allen Hillery (@AlDatavizguy).\n\n\nExample: One person’s experience with long COVID\nNYT article\n\nExample: Decolonizing data viz\nblog post\n\nExample: Visualizing climate change through art\nFutures North with Prof John Kim & Mac students (by Prof Kim, Mac research students)\n\nExample: Personal data collection\nDear Data\n\nPart c\nFor a deeper treatment of similar topics, and more examples, read Data Feminism.\n\nExercise 4: Critique\nPractice critiquing some more complicated data viz listed at Modern Data Science with R, Exercise 2.5.\nThink about the following questions:\n\nWhat story does the data graphic tell? What is the main message that you take away from it?\nCan the data graphic be described in terms of the Grammar of Graphics (frame, glyphs, aesthetics, facet, scale, guide)? If so, please describe.\nCritique and/or praise the visualization choices made by the designer. Do they work? Are they misleading? Thought-provoking? Are there things that you would have done differently?\n\n\nExercise 5: Design Details\nThis final exercise is just “food for thought”. It’s more of a discussion than an exercise, and gets into some of the finer design details and data viz theory. Go as deep or not deep as you’d like here.\nIn refining the details of our data viz, Visualize This and Storytelling with Data provide some of their guiding principles. But again, every context is different.\n\nPut yourself in a reader’s shoes. What parts of the data need explanation?\nShine a light on your data. Try to remove any “chart junk” that distracts from the data.\nVary color and style to emphasize the viz elements that are most important to the story you’re telling.\nIt is easier to judge length than it is to judge area or angles.\nBe thoughtful about how your categories are ordered for categorical data.\n\nGetting into even more of the nitty gritty, we need to be mindful of what geometric elements and aesthetics we use. The following elements/aesthetics are listed in roughly descending order of human ability to perceive and compare nearby objects:2\n\nPosition\nLength\nAngle\nDirection\nShape (but only a very few different shapes)\nArea\nVolume\nShade\nColor. (Color is the most difficult, because it is a 3-dimensional quantity.)\n\nFinally, here are some facts to keep in mind about visual perception from Now You See It.\nPart a: Selectivity\nVisual perception is selective, and our attention is often drawn to contrasts from the norm.\nImplication: We should design visualizations so that the features we want to highlight stand out in contrast from those that are not worth the audience’s attention.\nExample: What stands out in this example image? This is originally from C. Ware, Information Visualization: Perception for Design, 2004? Source: S. Few, Now You See It, 2009, p. 33.\n\nPart b: Familiarity\nOur eyes are drawn to familiar patterns. We observe what we know and expect.\nImplication: Visualizations work best when they display information as patterns that familiar and easy to spot.\nExample: Do you notice anything embedded in this rose image from coolbubble.com? Source: S. Few, Now You See It, 2009, p. 34.\n\nPart c: Revisit\nRevisit Part b. Do you notice anything in the shadows? Go to https://mac-stat.github.io/images/112/rose2.png for an image.",

    "text": "why “verbs”? in the tidyverse grammar, functions serve as action words\n\nthe 6 verbs are all stored in the dplyr package within the tidyverse\n\neach verb acts on a data frame and returns a data frame\n\n\n\nverb\naction\n\n\n\narrange\n\narrange the rows according to some column\n\n\n\nfilter\n\nfilter out or obtain a subset of the rows\n\n\n\nselect\n\nselect a subset of columns\n\n\n\nmutate\n\nmutate or create a column\n\n\n\nsummarize\ncalculate a numerical summary of a column\n\n\n\ngroup_by\n\ngroup the rows by a specified column\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17.1.1 Example 1\nWhich verb would help us…\n\nkeep only information about state names, county names, and the 2020 and 2016 Democratic support (not the 2012 results, demographics, etc) - Select\nget only the data on Minnesota - Filter\ndefine a new variable which calculates the change in Democratic support from 2016 to 2020, using dem_pct_20 and dem_pct_16 - mutate\nsort the counties from highest to lowest Democratic support - group-by\ndetermine the total number of votes cast across all counties - summarize\n\n17.1.2 Example 2: Select Columns\nTo get a sense for the code structure, let’s explore a couple verbs together. To start, let’s simplify our dataset to include only some variables of interest. Specifically, select() only the columns relevant to state names, county names, and the 2020 and 2016 Democratic support:\n\n# 'Select' certain columns from the data set.\nselect(elections, c(state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16))\n\nLet’s re-do this with the pipe function |&gt;:\n\nelections |&gt; \n  select(state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPipe Function |&gt;\n\n\n\n|&gt; “passes” objects, usually datasets, to a function:\nobject |&gt; function() is the same as function(object)\n\n\n\n17.1.3 Example 3: Filter Rows\nLet’s filter() out only the rows related to Minnesota (MN):\n\n# Without a pipe\nfilter(elections, state_name == \"Minnesota\")\n\n\n# With a pipe\nelections |&gt; \n  filter(state_name == \"Minnesota\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n== vs =\n\n\n\nWe use a == b to check whether a matches b.\nWe use a = b to define that a is equal to b. We typically use = for this purpose inside a function, and &lt;- for this purpose outside a function.\n\n# Ex: \"=\" defines x\nx = 2\nx\n\n[1] 2\n\n\n\n# Ex: \"==\" checks whether x is/matches 3\nx == 3\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\n\n\n\n17.1.4 Example 4: Filter and Select\nLet’s combine select() and filter() to create a new dataset with info about the county names, and 2020 and 2016 Democratic support among Minnesota counties.\n\n# Without pipes\nfilter(select(elections, c(state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16)), state_name == \"Minnesota\")\n\n\n# With pipes: all verbs in 1 row\nelections |&gt; select(state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16) |&gt; filter(state_name == \"Minnesota\")\n\n\n# With pipes: each verb in a new row\nelections |&gt; \n  select(state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16) |&gt; \n  filter(state_name == \"Minnesota\")\n\n\n# We can even do this with UN-tidyverse code in \"base\" R\nelections[elections$state_name == \"Minnesota\", c(1, 4, 8, 12)]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflection\n\n\n\nWhy will we typically use:\n\ntidyverse code\nthe pipe function |&gt;\n\neach verb on a new row\n\n\n\n\n17.1.5 Example 5: Order of Operations\nSometimes, the order of operations matters, eg, putting on socks then shoes produces a different result than putting on shoes then socks. However, sometimes order doesn’t matter, eg, pouring cereal into a bowl then adding milk produces the same result as pouring milk into a bow then adding cereal (though one order is obviously better than the other ;)) Above (also copied below), we selected some columns and then filtered some rows:\n\nelections |&gt; \n  select(state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16) |&gt; \n  filter(state_name == \"Minnesota\")\n\nWould we get the same result if we reversed select() and filter()? Think first, then try it.\n\n# Yes we get the same result \n elections |&gt; \n  filter(state_name == \"Minnesota\") |&gt;\n  select(state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16)\n\n   state_name

To this end, we must:\n\nIdentify the variable(s) that are relevant to the filter.\n\nUse a “logical comparison operator” to define which values of the variable to keep:\n\n\nsymbol\nmeaning\n\n\n\n==\nequal to\n\n\n!=\nnot equal to\n\n\n&gt;\ngreater than\n\n\n&gt;=\ngreater than or equal to\n\n\n&lt;\nless than\n\n\n&lt;=\nless than or equal to\n\n\n%in% c(???, ???)\na list of multiple values\n\n\n\n\nUse quotes \"\" when specifying outcomes of interest for a categorical variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommenting/Uncommenting Code\n\n\n\nTo comment/uncomment several lines of code at once, highlight them then click ctrl/cmd+shift+c.\n\n\n\n# Keep only data on counties in Hawaii\nelections_small |&gt;\n  filter(state_name == 'Hawaii')\n\n  state_name     county_name total_votes_20 repub_pct_20 dem_pct_20\n1     Hawaii   Hawaii County          87814        30.63      66.88\n2     Hawaii Honolulu County         382114        35.66      62.51\n3     Hawaii    Kauai County          33497        34.58      63.36\n4     Hawaii     Maui County          71044        31.14      66.59\n  total_votes_16 dem_pct_16\n1          64865      63.61\n2         285683      61.48\n3          26335      62.49\n4          51942      64.45\n\n\n\n# Keeps data from Hawaii and Delaware\nelections_small |&gt; \n  filter(state_name %in% c(\"Hawaii\", \"Delaware\"))\n\n  state_name       county_name total_votes_20 repub_pct_20 dem_pct_20\n1   Delaware       Kent County          87025        47.12      51.19\n2   Delaware New Castle County         287633        30.72      67.81\n3   Delaware     Sussex County         129352        55.07      43.82\n4     Hawaii     Hawaii County          87814        30.63      66.88\n5     Hawaii   Honolulu County         382114        35.66      62.51\n6     Hawaii      Kauai County          33497        34.58      63.36\n7     Hawaii       Maui County          71044        31.14      66.59\n  total_votes_16 dem_pct_16\n1          74253      44.91\n2         261468      62.30\n3         105814      37.17\n4          64865      63.61\n5         285683      61.48\n6          26335      62.49\n7          51942      64.45\n\n\n\n# Keep only data on counties where the Republican got MORE THAN 93.97% of the vote in 2020\n# THINK: What variable is relevant here?\nelections_small |&gt; \n  filter(repub_pct_20  &gt; 93.97)\n\n  state_name    county_name total_votes_20 repub_pct_20 dem_pct_20\n1      Texas  Borden County            416        95.43       3.85\n2      Texas    King County            159        94.97       5.03\n3      Texas Roberts County            550        96.18       3.09\n  total_votes_16 dem_pct_16\n1            365       8.49\n2            159       3.14\n3            550       3.64\n\n\n\n# Keep only data on counties where the Republican got AT LEAST 93.97% of the vote in 2020\n# This should have 1 more row (observation) than your answer above\nelections_small |&gt; \n  filter(repub_pct_20  &gt;= 93.97)\n\n  state_name     county_name total_votes_20 repub_pct_20 dem_pct_20\n1    Montana Garfield County            813        93.97       5.04\n2      Texas   Borden County            416        95.43       3.85\n3      Texas     King County            159        94.97       5.03\n4      Texas  Roberts County            550        96.18       3.09\n  total_votes_16 dem_pct_16\n1            715       4.76\n2            365       8.49\n3            159       3.14\n4            550       3.64\n\n\nWe can also filter with respect to 2 rules!

Alone, this function doesn’t change the appearance of our dataset or seem to do anything at all:\n\n elections_small |&gt; \n   group_by(state_name)\n\n# A tibble: 3,109 × 7\n# Groups:   state_name [50]\n   state_name county_name  total_votes_20 repub_pct_20 dem_pct_20 total_votes_16\n   &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;                 &lt;int&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;int&gt;\n 1 Alabama    Autauga Cou…          27770         71.4      27.0           24661\n 2 Alabama    Baldwin Cou…         109679         76.2      22.4           94090\n 3 Alabama    Barbour Cou…          10518         53.4      45.8           10390\n 4 Alabama    Bibb County            9595         78.4      20.7            8748\n 5 Alabama    Blount Coun…          27588         89.6       9.57          25384\n 6 Alabama    Bullock Cou…           4613         24.8      74.7            4701\n 7 Alabama    Butler Coun…           9488         57.5      41.8            8685\n 8 Alabama    Calhoun Cou…          50983         68.8      29.8           47376\n 9 Alabama    Chambers Co…          15284         57.3      41.6           13778\n10 Alabama    Cherokee Co…          12301         86.0      13.2           10503\n# ℹ 3,099 more rows\n# ℹ 1 more variable: dem_pct_16 &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\nThough it does change the underlying structure of the dataset:\n\n# Check out the structure before and after group_by\nelections_small |&gt; \n   class()\n\n[1] \"data.frame\"\n\n elections_small |&gt; \n   group_by(state_name) |&gt; \n   class()\n\n[1] \"grouped_df\" \"tbl_df\"     \"tbl\"        \"data.frame\"\n\n\nWhere it really shines is in partnership with summarize().\n\n# calculate the republican median and the total votes per state\n# we would get the results by county\nelections_small |&gt; \n   group_by(state_name) |&gt; \n   summarize(median_repub = median(repub_pct_20), total_votes = sum(total_votes_20)) \n\n# A tibble: 50 × 3\n   state_name           median_repub total_votes\n   &lt;chr&gt;                       &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;int&gt;\n 1 Alabama                      70.6     2323304\n 2 Arizona                      57.9     3387326\n 3 Arkansas                     72.1     1219069\n 4 California                   44.8    17495906\n 5 Colorado                     56.2     3256953\n 6 Connecticut                  41.0     1824280\n 7 Delaware                     47.1      504010\n 8 District of Columbia          5.4      344356\n 9 Florida                      64.6    11067456\n10 Georgia                      68       4997716\n# ℹ 40 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflect\n\n\n\nNotice that group_by() with summarize() produces new data frame or tibble! But the units of observation are now states instead of counties within states.\n\n\nExercise 9: DIY\nLet’s practice (some of) our 6 verbs: select, filter, arrange, mutate, summarize, group_by Remember:\n\nBefore writing any code, translate the given prompts: how many distinct wrangling steps are needed and what verb do we need in each step?\nAdd each verb one at a time.\n\nPart a\nNOTE: Part a is a challenge exercise.

The right approach depends upon your research goals. A general rule is: Only get rid of observations with missing data if they’re missing data on variables you need for the specific task at hand!\n\n\nExample 1\nSuppose our research focus is just on body_mass_g. Two penguins are missing this info:\n\n# NOTE the use of is.na()\npenguins |&gt; \n  summarize(sum(is.na(body_mass_g)))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  `sum(is.na(body_mass_g))`\n                      &lt;int&gt;\n1                         2\n\n\nLet’s define a new dataset that removes these penguins:\n\n# NOTE the use of is.na()\npenguins_w_body_mass &lt;- penguins |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(body_mass_g))\n\n# Compare the number of penguins in this vs the original data\nnrow(penguins_w_body_mass)\n\n[1] 342\n\nnrow(penguins)\n\n[1] 344\n\n\nNote that some penguins in penguins_w_body_mass are missing info on sex, but we don’t care since that’s not related to our research question:\n\npenguins_w_body_mass |&gt; \n  summarize(sum(is.na(sex)))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  `sum(is.na(sex))`\n              &lt;int&gt;\n1                 9\n\n\nExample 2\nIn the very rare case that we need complete information on every variable for the specific task at hand, we can use na.omit() to get rid of any penguin that’s missing info on any variable:\n\npenguins_complete &lt;- penguins |&gt; \n  na.omit()\n\nHow many penguins did this eliminate?\n\nnrow(penguins_complete)\n\n[1] 333\n\nnrow(penguins)\n\n[1] 344\n\n\nPart c\nExplain why we should only use na.omit() in extreme circumstances.\nBecause we could use important information and/or observations because it is missing on variable but not the others. We should only do this in case we need all the variables for our research. If not the research could be misleading or bias and do not reflect the reality.\n\nExercise 2: More Selecting\nBeing able to select() only certain columns can help simplify our data. This is especially important when we’re working with lots of columns (which we haven’t done yet). It can also get tedious to type out every column of interest. Here are some shortcuts:\n\n\n- removes a given variable and keeps all others (e.g. select(-island))\n\nstarts_with(\"___\"), ends_with(\"___\"), or contains(\"___\") selects only the columns that either start with, end with, or simply contain the given string of characters\n\nUse these shortcuts to create the following datasets.\n\n# First: recall the variable names\nnames(penguins)\n\n[1] \"species\"           \"island\"            \"bill_length_mm\"   \n[4] \"bill_depth_mm\"     \"flipper_length_mm\" \"body_mass_g\"      \n[7] \"sex\"               \"year\"             \n\n\n\n# Use a shortcut to keep everything but the year and island variables\npenguins|&gt;\n  select(-island, - year) |&gt; head()\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 6\n  species bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length_mm body_mass_g sex   \n  &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; \n1 Adelie            39.1          18.7               181        3750 male  \n2 Adelie            39.5          17.4               186        3800 female\n3 Adelie            40.3          18                 195        3250 female\n4 Adelie            NA            NA                  NA          NA &lt;NA&gt;  \n5 Adelie            36.7          19.3               193        3450 female\n6 Adelie            39.3          20.6               190        3650 male  \n\n\n\n# Use a shortcut to keep only species and the penguin characteristics measured in mm\npenguins |&gt;\n  select(species, ends_with(\"mm\")) |&gt; head()\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n  species bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length_mm\n  &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Adelie            39.1          18.7               181\n2 Adelie            39.5          17.4               186\n3 Adelie            40.3          18                 195\n4 Adelie            NA            NA                  NA\n5 Adelie            36.7          19.3               193\n6 Adelie            39.3          20.6               190\n\n\n\n# Use a shortcut to keep only species and bill-related measurements\npenguins|&gt;\n  select(species, starts_with(\"bill\")) |&gt;head()\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  species bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm\n  &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Adelie            39.1          18.7\n2 Adelie            39.5          17.4\n3 Adelie            40.3          18  \n4 Adelie            NA            NA  \n5 Adelie            36.7          19.3\n6 Adelie            39.3          20.6\n\n\n\n# Use a shortcut to keep only species and the length-related characteristics\npenguins|&gt;\n  select(species, contains(\"length\"))\n\n# A tibble: 344 × 3\n   species bill_length_mm flipper_length_mm\n   &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Adelie            39.1               181\n 2 Adelie            39.5               186\n 3 Adelie            40.3               195\n 4 Adelie            NA                  NA\n 5 Adelie            36.7               193\n 6 Adelie            39.3               190\n 7 Adelie            38.9               181\n 8 Adelie            39.2               195\n 9 Adelie            34.1               193\n10 Adelie            42                 190\n# ℹ 334 more rows\n\n\n\nExercise 3: Arranging, Counting, & Grouping by Multiple Variables\nWe’ve done examples where we need to filter() by more than one variable, or select() more than one variable.

Dates are a whole special object type or class in R that automatically respect the order of time.\n\n# Get today's date\nas.Date(today())\n\n[1] \"2025-03-28\"\n\n# Let's store this as \"today\" so we can work with it below\ntoday &lt;- as.Date(today())\n\n# Check out the class of this object\nclass(today)\n\n[1] \"Date\"\n\n\nThe lubridate package inside tidyverse contains functions that can extract various information from dates.

Let’s apply these ideas to the daily Birthdays dataset in the mosaic package.\n\nlibrary(mosaic)\ndata(\"Birthdays\")\nhead(Birthdays)\n\n  state year month day       date wday births\n1    AK 1969     1   1 1969-01-01  Wed     14\n2    AL 1969     1   1 1969-01-01  Wed    174\n3    AR 1969     1   1 1969-01-01  Wed     78\n4    AZ 1969     1   1 1969-01-01  Wed     84\n5    CA 1969     1   1 1969-01-01  Wed    824\n6    CO 1969     1   1 1969-01-01  Wed    100\n\n\nBirthdays gives the number of births recorded on each day of the year in each state from 1969 to 19881. We can use our wrangling skills to understand some drivers of daily births. Putting these all together can be challenging! Remember the following ways to make tasks more manageable:\n\nTranslate the prompt into our 6 verbs (and count()). That is, think before you type.\nBuild your code line by line. It’s important to understand what’s being piped into each function!\n\nExercise 5: Warming up\n\n# How many days of data do we have for each state?\n\n# How many total births were there in this time period?\nBirthdays |&gt;\n  summarise(sum(births))\n\n  sum(births)\n1    70486538\n\n# How many total births were there per state in this time period, sorted from low to high?\nBirthdays |&gt;\n  group_by(state) |&gt;\n  summarise(total_births = sum(births)) |&gt;\n  arrange(total_births)\n\n# A tibble: 51 × 2\n   state total_births\n   &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;int&gt;\n 1 VT          147886\n 2 WY          154019\n 3 AK          185385\n 4 DE          188705\n 5 SD          235734\n 6 ND          238696\n 7 NV          241470\n 8 MT          253884\n 9 NH          264984\n10 RI          265038\n# ℹ 41 more rows\n\n\nExercise 6: Homework Reprise\nCreate a new dataset named daily_births that includes the total number of births per day (across all states) and the corresponding day of the week, eg, Mon. NOTE: Name the column with total births so that it’s easier to wrangle and plot.\n\ndaily_births &lt;- Birthdays |&gt;\n  group_by(day) |&gt;\n  summarise(total_births = sum(births)) |&gt;\n  mutate(day_of_week = wday(day, label = TRUE))\n\ndaily_births\n\n# A tibble: 31 × 3\n     day total_births day_of_week\n   &lt;int&gt;        &lt;int&gt; &lt;ord&gt;      \n 1     1      2286854 Sun        \n 2     2      2303168 Mon        \n 3     3      2309087 Tue        \n 4     4      2286588 Wed        \n 5     5      2296951 Thu        \n 6     6      2308073 Fri        \n 7     7      2314081 Sat        \n 8     8      2322376 &lt;NA&gt;       \n 9     9      2315055 &lt;NA&gt;       \n10    10      2327197 &lt;NA&gt;       \n# ℹ 21 more rows\n\n\nUsing this data, construct a plot of births over time, indicating the day of week.\nExercise 7: Wrangle & Plot\nFor each prompt below, you can decide whether you want to: (1) wrangle and store data, then plot; or (2) wrangle data and pipe directly into ggplot. For example:\n\npenguins |&gt; \n  filter(species != \"Gentoo\") |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(y = bill_length_mm, x = bill_depth_mm, color = species)) + \n    geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart a\nCalculate the total number of births in each month and year, eg, Jan 1969, Feb 1969, …. Label month by names not numbers, eg, Jan not 1. Then, plot the births by month and comment on what you learn.\n\nmonthly_birthdays &lt;- Birthdays |&gt;\n  mutate(month_name = month(date, label = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  group_by(year, month_name) |&gt;\n  summarise(total_births = sum(births))\n\nggplot(monthly_birthdays, aes(x = month_name, y = total_births)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", show.legend = FALSE) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nIn 1988, calculate the total number of births per week in each state. Get rid of week “53”, which isn’t a complete week! Then, make a line plot of births by week for each state and comment on what you learn. For example, do you notice any seasonal trends? Are these the same in every state? Any outliers?\n\nweekly_births_1988 &lt;- Birthdays |&gt;\n  filter(year == 1988) |&gt;\n  mutate(week_of_year = week(date)) |&gt;\n  filter(week_of_year != 53) |&gt;\n  group_by(state, week_of_year) |&gt;\n  summarise(total_births = sum(births))\n\nggplot(weekly_births_1988, aes(y = total_births, x = week_of_year, colour = state)) +\n  geom_line()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart c\nRepeat the above for just Minnesota (MN) and Louisiana (LA). MN has one of the coldest climates and LA has one of the warmest. How do their seasonal trends compare? Do you think these trends are similar in other colder and warmer states? Try it!\n\nMN_LA_births &lt;- Birthdays |&gt;\n  filter(year == 1988, state %in% c(\"MN\", \"LA\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(week_of_year = week(date)) |&gt;\n  filter(week_of_year != 53) |&gt;\n  group_by(state, week_of_year) |&gt;\n  summarise(total_births = sum(births))\n\nggplot(MN_LA_births, aes(x = week_of_year, y = total_births, color = state)) +\n  geom_line()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 8: More Practice\n\n18.3.0.1 Part a\nCreate a dataset with only births in Massachusetts (MA) in 1979 and sort the days from those with the most births to those with the fewest.\n\nMA_1979_Births &lt;- Birthdays |&gt;\n  filter(year == 1979, state == \"MA\") |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(births))\n\nhead(MA_1979_Births)\n\n  state year month day       date wday births\n1    MA 1979     9  28 1979-09-28  Fri    262\n2    MA 1979     9  11 1979-09-11 Tues    252\n3    MA 1979    12  28 1979-12-28  Fri    249\n4    MA 1979     9  26 1979-09-26  Wed    246\n5    MA 1979     7  24 1979-07-24 Tues    245\n6    MA 1979     4  27 1979-04-27  Fri    243\n\n\nPart b\nMake a table showing the five states with the most births between September 9, 1979 and September 12, 1979, including the 9th and 12th. Arrange the table in descending order of births.",

    "text": "19.2 Reshaping Data\nThere are two general types of reshaped data:\n\naggregate data\nFor example, using group_by() with summarize() gains aggregate information about our observations but loses data on individual observations.\nraw data, reshaped\nWe often want to retain all information on individual observations, but need to reshape it in order to perform the task at hand.\n\nExample 4: reshape it with your mind\nLet’s calculate the difference in average body mass, male vs female, for each species. Since penguin_avg is small, we could do these calculations by hand. But this doesn’t scale up to bigger datasets.\n\nSketch out (on paper, in your head, anything) how this data would need to be reshaped, without losing any information, in order to calculate the differences in average body mass using our wrangling verbs. Make it as specific as possible, with column labels, entries, correct numbers, etc.\nIdentify the units of observation.\n\n\npenguin_avg\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n# Groups:   species [3]\n  species   sex    avg_body_mass\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Adelie    female         3369.\n2 Adelie    male           4043.\n3 Chinstrap female         3527.\n4 Chinstrap male           3939.\n5 Gentoo    female         4680.\n6 Gentoo    male           5485.\n\n\nWider vs Longer formats\nMaking our data longer or wider reshapes the data, changing the units of observation while retaining all raw information:\n\nMake the data longer, i.e. combine values from multiple variables into 1 variable. Example: 1999 and 2000 represent two years. We want to combine their results into 1 variable without losing any information.\n\n\n\nMake the data wider, i.e. spread out the values across new variables. Example: cases and pop represent two categories within type. To compare or combine their count outcomes side-by-side, we can separate them into their own variables.\n\n\nExample 5: pivot wider\nBecause it’s a small enough dataset to examine all at once, let’s start with our penguin_avg data:\n\npenguin_avg\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n# Groups:   species [3]\n  species   sex    avg_body_mass\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Adelie    female         3369.\n2 Adelie    male           4043.\n3 Chinstrap female         3527.\n4 Chinstrap male           3939.\n5 Gentoo    female         4680.\n6 Gentoo    male           5485.\n\n\nWith the goal of being able to calculate the difference in average body mass, male vs female, for each species, let’s make the dataset wider. That is, let’s get one row per species with separate columns for the average body mass by sex. Put this code into a chunk and run it:\n\npenguin_avg |&gt; \npivot_wider(names_from = sex, values_from = avg_body_mass)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n# Groups:   species [3]\n  species   female  male\n  &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Adelie     3369. 4043.\n2 Chinstrap  3527. 3939.\n3 Gentoo     4680. 5485.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPivot Wider\n\n\n\n\n\nnames_from = the variable whose values we want to separate into their own columns, i.e. where we want to get the new column names from\n\n\nvalues_from = which variable to take the new column values from\n\n\n\n\nFOLLOW-UP:\n\nWhat are the units of observation?\nDid we lose any information when we widened the data?\nUse the wide data to calculate the difference in average body mass, male vs female, for each species.\nExample 6: Pivot longer\nLet’s store our wide data:\n\npenguin_avg_wide &lt;- penguin_avg |&gt; \n  pivot_wider(names_from = sex, values_from = avg_body_mass)\n\npenguin_avg_wide\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n# Groups:   species [3]\n  species   female  male\n  &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Adelie     3369. 4043.\n2 Chinstrap  3527. 3939.\n3 Gentoo     4680. 5485.\n\n\nSuppose we wanted to change this data back to a longer format. In general, this happens when some variables (here female and male) represent two categories or values of some broader variable (here sex), and we want to combine them into that 1 variable without losing any information.

Subjects\nPart b\nSuppose I ask you to plot each subject’s reaction time (y-axis) vs the number of days of sleep restriction (x-axis). “Sketch” out in words what the first few rows of the data need to look like in order to do this. It might help to think about what you’d need to complete the plotting frame:\nggplot(sleep_wide, aes(y = reaction_time, x = days_of_sleep, color = subject))\nPart c\nHow can you obtain the dataset you sketched in part b?\n\njust using sleep_wide\n\npivot_longer()\npivot_wider()\nExercise 2: Pivot longer\nTo plot reaction time by day for each subject, we need to reshape the data into a long format where each row represents a subject/day combination. Specifically, we want a dataset with 3 columns and a first few rows that look something like this:\n\n\nSubject\nday\nreaction_time\n\n\n\n308\n0\n249.56\n\n\n308\n1\n258.70\n\n\n308\n2\n250.80\n\n\n\nPart a\nUse pivot_longer() to create the long-format dataset above. Show the first 3 lines (head(3)), which should be similar to those above. Follow-up: Thinking forward to plotting reaction time vs day for each subject, what would you like to fix / change about this dataset?\n\n# For cols, try 2 appproaches: using - and starts_with\n sleep_wide |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with(\"day\"), names_to = \"day\", values_to = \"raction_time\") |&gt; head(3)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  Subject day   raction_time\n    &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     308 day_0         250.\n2     308 day_1         259.\n3     308 day_2         251.\n\n\nPart b\nRun this chunk:\n\nsleep_long &lt;- sleep_wide |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = -Subject,\n               names_to = \"day\",\n               names_prefix = \"day_\",\n               values_to = \"reaction_time\")\n\nhead(sleep_long)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  Subject day   reaction_time\n    &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     308 0              250.\n2     308 1              259.\n3     308 2              251.\n4     308 3              321.\n5     308 4              357.\n6     308 5              415.\n\n\nFollow-up:\n\nBesides putting each argument on a different line for readability and storing the results, what changed in the code? it was added names_prefix = “day_”\nHow did this impact how the values are recorded in the day column? it kept the day number without the prefix day_\nPart c\nUsing sleep_long, construct a line plot of reaction time vs day for each subject. This will look goofy no matter what you do. Why? HINT: look back at head(sleep_long). What class or type of variables are Subject and day? What do we want them to be?\n\nsubject is an integer and day is a character. We want them to be categorical and numerical, respectively.\n\n\nggplot(sleep_long, aes(x = day, y = reaction_time, color = Subject)) +\n  geom_line()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3: Changing variable classes & plotting\nLet’s finalize sleep_long by mutating the Subject variable to be a factor (categorical) and the day variable to be numeric (quantitative). Take note of the mutate() code! You’ll use this type of code a lot.\n\nsleep_long &lt;- sleep_wide |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = -Subject,\n               names_to = \"day\",\n               names_prefix = \"day_\",\n               values_to = \"reaction_time\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Subject = as.factor(Subject), day = as.numeric(day))\n\n# Check it out\n# Same data, different class\nhead(sleep_long)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  Subject   day reaction_time\n  &lt;fct&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 308         0          250.\n2 308         1          259.\n3 308         2          251.\n4 308         3          321.\n5 308         4          357.\n6 308         5          415.\n\n\nPart a\nNow make some plots.\n\n# Make a line plot of reaction time by day for each subject\n# Put these all on the same frame\n\nggplot(sleep_long, aes(y = reaction_time, x = day, colour = Subject)) +\n  geom_line()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Make a line plot of reaction time by day for each subject\n# Put these all on separate frames (one per subject)\n\nggplot(sleep_long, aes(y = reaction_time, x = day, colour = Subject)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  facet_wrap(~Subject)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nSummarize what you learned from the plots. For example:\n\nWhat’s the general relationship between reaction time and sleep?\nIs this the same for everybody? What differs?\n\n\nReaction time increases with a lack of sleep. Some subject seem to be more impacted than others by lack of sleep, and some tend to have faster, slower reactions times in general.\n\nExercise 4: Pivot wider\nMake the data wide again, with each day becoming its own column.\nPart a\nAdjust the code below.

And get rid of any rows missing information on broad_group. You’ll learn the code soon! For now, just run this chunk:\n\nplot_data &lt;- daily |&gt; \n  mutate(broad_group = case_when(\n    group %in% c(\"Acting\", \"Athletics\", \"Comedy\", \"Musician\") ~ \"Acting, Comedy & Music\",\n    group %in% c(\"Media\", \"media\", \"Science\", \"Academic\", \"Consultant\", \"Clergy\") ~ \"Media\",\n    group %in% c(\"Politician\", \"Political Aide\", \"Government\", \"Military\", \"Business\", \"Advocacy\") ~ \"Government and Politics\",\n    .default = NA\n  )) |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(broad_group))\n\nNow, using the broad_group variable in plot_data, recreate the graphic from the article, with three different lines showing the fraction of guests in each group over time. Note: You’ll have to wrangle the data first.\n\nplot_data |&gt;\n  group_by(year, broad_group) |&gt;\n  summarise(n = n())|&gt;\n  mutate(freq = n/sum(n)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(y = freq, x = year, color = broad_group)) +\n  geom_line()",

    "text": "20.6 Exercises\nExercise 1: Where are my keys?\nPart a\nDefine two new datasets, with different students and courses:\n\nstudents_2 &lt;- data.frame(\n  student = c(\"D\", \"E\", \"F\"),\n  class = c(\"COMP 101\", \"BIOL 101\", \"POLI 101\")\n)\n\n# Check it out\nstudents_2\n\n  student    class\n1       D COMP 101\n2       E BIOL 101\n3       F POLI 101\n\nenrollments_2 &lt;- data.frame(\n  course = c(\"ART 101\", \"BIOL 101\", \"COMP 101\"),\n  enrollment = c(18, 20, 19)\n)\n\n# Check it out\nenrollments_2\n\n    course enrollment\n1  ART 101         18\n2 BIOL 101         20\n3 COMP 101         19\n\n\nTo connect the course enrollments to the students’ courses, try do a left_join(). You get an error! Identify the problem by reviewing the error message and the datasets we’re trying to join.\n\n# eval = FALSE: don't evaluate this chunk when knitting. it produces an error.\nstudents_2 |&gt; \n  left_join(enrollments_2)\n\nPart b\nThe problem is that course name, the key or variable that links these two datasets, is labeled differently: class in the students_2 data and course in the enrollments_2 data. Thus we have to specify these keys in our code:\n\nstudents_2 |&gt; \n  left_join(enrollments_2, join_by(class == course))\n\n  student    class enrollment\n1       D COMP 101         19\n2       E BIOL 101         20\n3       F POLI 101         NA\n\n\n\n# The order of the keys is important:\n# join_by(\"left data key\" == \"right data key\")\n# The order is mixed up here, thus we get an error:\nstudents_2 |&gt; \n  left_join(enrollments_2, join_by(course == class))\n\nPart c\nDefine another set of fake data which adds grade information:\n\n# Add student grades in each course\nstudents_3 &lt;- data.frame(\n  student = c(\"Y\", \"Y\", \"Z\", \"Z\"),\n  class = c(\"COMP 101\", \"BIOL 101\", \"POLI 101\", \"COMP 101\"),\n  grade = c(\"B\", \"S\", \"C\", \"A\")\n)\n\n# Check it out\nstudents_3\n\n  student    class grade\n1       Y COMP 101     B\n2       Y BIOL 101     S\n3       Z POLI 101     C\n4       Z COMP 101     A\n\n# Add average grades in each course\nenrollments_3 &lt;- data.frame(\n  class = c(\"ART 101\", \"BIOL 101\",\"COMP 101\"),\n  grade = c(\"B\", \"A\", \"A-\"),\n  enrollment = c(20, 18, 19)\n)\n\n# Check it out\nenrollments_3\n\n     class grade enrollment\n1  ART 101     B         20\n2 BIOL 101     A         18\n3 COMP 101    A-         19\n\n\nTry doing a left_join() to link the students’ classes to their enrollment info. Did this work? Try and figure out the culprit by examining the output.\n\nstudents_3 |&gt; \n  left_join(enrollments_3)\n\n  student    class grade enrollment\n1       Y COMP 101     B         NA\n2       Y BIOL 101     S         NA\n3       Z POLI 101     C         NA\n4       Z COMP 101     A         NA\n\n\nPart d\nThe issue here is that our datasets have 2 column names in common: class and grade. BUT grade is measuring 2 different things here: individual student grades in students_3 and average student grades in enrollments_3. Thus it doesn’t make sense to try to join the datasets with respect to this variable. We can again solve this by specifying that we want to join the datasets using the class variable as a key. What are grade.x and grade.y?\n\nstudents_3 |&gt; \n  left_join(enrollments_3, join_by(class == class))\n\n  student    class grade.x grade.y enrollment\n1       Y COMP 101       B      A-         19\n2       Y BIOL 101       S       A         18\n3       Z POLI 101       C    &lt;NA&gt;         NA\n4       Z COMP 101       A      A-         19\n\n\nExercise 2: More small practice\nBefore applying these ideas to bigger datasets, let’s practice identifying which join is appropriate in different scenarios. Define the following fake data on voters (people who have voted) and contact info for voting age adults (people who could vote):\n\n# People who have voted\nvoters &lt;- data.frame(\n  id = c(\"A\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\", \"G\"),\n  times_voted = c(2, 4, 17, 6, 20)\n)\n\nvoters\n\n  id times_voted\n1  A           2\n2  D           4\n3  E          17\n4  F           6\n5  G          20\n\n# Contact info for voting age adults\ncontact &lt;- data.frame(\n  name = c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\"),\n  address = c(\"summit\", \"grand\", \"snelling\", \"fairview\"),\n  age = c(24, 89, 43, 38)\n)\n\ncontact\n\n  name  address age\n1    A   summit  24\n2    B    grand  89\n3    C snelling  43\n4    D fairview  38\n\n\nUse the appropriate join for each prompt below. In each case, think before you type:\n\nWhat dataset goes on the left?\nWhat do you want the resulting dataset to look like? How many rows and columns will it have?\n\n\n# 1. We want contact info for people who HAVEN'T voted\ncontact |&gt;\n  anti_join(voters, join_by(name == id))\n\n  name  address age\n1    B    grand  89\n2    C snelling  43\n\n# 2. We want contact info for people who HAVE voted\ncontact |&gt;\n  semi_join(voters, join_by(name == id))\n\n  name  address age\n1    A   summit  24\n2    D fairview  38\n\n# 3. We want any data available on each person\ncontact |&gt;\n  full_join(voters, join_by(name == id))\n\n  name  address age times_voted\n1    A   summit  24           2\n2    B    grand  89          NA\n3    C snelling  43          NA\n4    D fairview  38           4\n5    E     &lt;NA&gt;  NA          17\n6    F     &lt;NA&gt;  NA           6\n7    G     &lt;NA&gt;  NA          20\n\n# 4. When possible, we want to add contact info to the voting roster\n\nExercise 3: Bigger datasets\nLet’s apply these ideas to some bigger datasets. In grades, each row is a student-class pair with information on:\n\n\nsid = student ID\n\ngrade = student’s grade\n\nsessionID = an identifier of the class section\n\n\n# Get rid of some duplicate rows!\ngrades &lt;- read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/grades.csv\") |&gt; \n  distinct(sid, sessionID, .keep_all = TRUE)\nhead(grades)\n\n     sid grade   sessionID\n1 S31185    D+ session1784\n2 S31185    B+ session1785\n3 S31185    A- session1791\n4 S31185    B+ session1792\n5 S31185    B- session1794\n6 S31185    C+ session1795\n\n\nIn courses, each row corresponds to a class section with information on:\n\n\nsessionID = an identifier of the class section\n\ndept = department\n\nlevel = course level (eg: 100)\n\nsem = semester\n\nenroll = enrollment (number of students)\n\niid = instructor ID\n\n\n\n    sessionID dept level    sem enroll     iid\n1 session1784    M   100 FA1991     22 inst265\n2 session1785    k   100 FA1991     52 inst458\n3 session1791    J   100 FA1993     22 inst223\n4 session1792    J   300 FA1993     20 inst235\n5 session1794    J   200 FA1993     22 inst234\n6 session1795    J   200 SP1994     26 inst230\n\n\nUse R code to take a quick glance at the data.\n\n# How many observations (rows) and variables (columns) are there in the grades data? 5844 rows and 3 columns\ndim(grades)\n\n[1] 5844    3\n\n# How many observations (rows) and variables (columns) are there in the courses data? 1718 rows and 6 columns \ndim(courses)\n\n[1] 1718    6\n\n\nExercise 4: Class size\nHow big are the classes?\nPart a\nBefore digging in, note that some courses are listed twice in the courses data:\n\ncourses |&gt; \n  count(sessionID) |&gt; \n  filter(n &gt; 1)\n\n     sessionID n\n1  session2047 2\n2  session2067 2\n3  session2448 2\n4  session2509 2\n5  session2541 2\n6  session2824 2\n7  session2826 2\n8  session2862 2\n9  session2897 2\n10 session3046 2\n11 session3057 2\n12 session3123 2\n13 session3243 2\n14 session3257 2\n15 session3387 2\n16 session3400 2\n17 session3414 2\n18 session3430 2\n19 session3489 2\n20 session3524 2\n21 session3629 2\n22 session3643 2\n23 session3821 2\n\n\nIf we pick out just 1 of these, we learn that some courses are cross-listed in multiple departments:\n\ncourses |&gt; \n  filter(sessionID == \"session2047\")\n\n    sessionID dept level    sem enroll     iid\n1 session2047    g   100 FA2001     12 inst436\n2 session2047    m   100 FA2001     28 inst436\n\n\nFor our class size exploration, obtain the total enrollments in each sessionID, combining any cross-listed sections. Save this as courses_combined. NOTE: There’s no joining to do here!\n\n courses_combined &lt;- courses |&gt; \n   group_by(sessionID) |&gt; \n   summarise(enroll = sum(enroll))\n\n# Check that this has 1695 rows and 2 columns\n dim(courses_combined)\n\n[1] 1695    2\n\n\nPart b\nLet’s first examine the question of class size from the administration’s viewpoint. To this end, calculate the median class size across all class sections. (The median is the middle or 50th percentile. Unlike the mean, it’s not skewed by outliers.) THINK FIRST:\n\nWhich of the 2 datasets do you need to answer this question? One? Both?\nIf you need course information, use courses_combined not courses.\nDo you have to do any joining? If so, which dataset will go on the left, i.e. which dataset includes your primary observations of interest? Which join function will you need?\nPart c\nBut how big are classes from the student perspective? To this end, calculate the median class size for each individual student. Once you have the correct output, store it as student_class_size. THINK FIRST:\n\nWhich of the 2 datasets do you need to answer this question? One? Both?\nIf you need course information, use courses_combined not courses.\nDo you have to do any joining? If so, which dataset will go on the left, i.e. which dataset includes your primary observations of interest? Which join function will you need?\nPart d\nThe median class size varies from student to student. To get a sense for the typical student experience and range in student experiences, construct and discuss a histogram of the median class sizes experienced by the students.\n\n# ggplot(student_class_size, aes(x = ___)) + \n#   geom___()\n\nExercise 5: Narrowing in on classes\nPart a\nShow data on the students that enrolled in session1986. THINK FIRST: Which of the 2 datasets do you need to answer this question? One? Both?\nPart b\nBelow is a dataset with all courses in department E:\n\ndept_E &lt;- courses |&gt; \n  filter(dept == \"E\")\n\nWhat students enrolled in classes in department E? (We just want info on the students, not the classes.)\nExercise 6: All the wrangling\nUse all of your wrangling skills to answer the following prompts! THINK FIRST:\n\nThink about what tables you might need to join (if any). Identify the corresponding variables to match.\nYou’ll need an extra table to convert grades to grade point averages:\n\n\ngpa_conversion &lt;- tibble(\n  grade = c(\"A+\", \"A\", \"A-\", \"B+\", \"B\", \"B-\", \"C+\", \"C\", \"C-\", \"D+\", \"D\", \"D-\", \"NC\", \"AU\", \"S\"), \n  gp = c(4.3, 4, 3.7, 3.3, 3, 2.7, 2.3, 2, 1.7, 1.3, 1, 0.7, 0, NA, NA)\n)\n\ngpa_conversion\n\n# A tibble: 15 × 2\n   grade    gp\n   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 A+      4.3\n 2 A       4  \n 3 A-      3.7\n 4 B+      3.3\n 5 B       3  \n 6 B-      2.7\n 7 C+      2.3\n 8 C       2  \n 9 C-      1.7\n10 D+      1.3\n11 D       1  \n12 D-      0.7\n13 NC      0  \n14 AU     NA  \n15 S      NA  \n\n\nPart a\nHow many total student enrollments are there in each department? Order from high to low.\nPart b\nWhat’s the grade-point average (GPA) for each student?\nPart c\nWhat’s the median GPA across all students?\nPart d\nWhat fraction of grades are below B+?\nPart e\nWhat’s the grade-point average for each instructor? Order from low to high.\nPart f\nCHALLENGE: Estimate the grade-point average for each department, and sort from low to high. NOTE: Don’t include cross-listed courses. Students in cross-listed courses could be enrolled under either department, and we do not know which department to assign the grade to. HINT: You’ll need to do multiple joins.",

    "text": "21.2 Factors\nIn the remaining days of our data preparation unit, we’ll focus on working with special types of “categorical” variables: characters and factors. Variables with these structures often require special tools and considerations.\nWe’ll focus on two common considerations:\n\n\nRegular expressions\nWhen working with character strings, we might want to detect, replace, or extract certain patterns.

This is because dem_support_20 is a character variable and R thinks of character strings as words, not category labels with any meaningful order (other than alphabetical):\n\nstr(elections)\n\n'data.frame':   3109 obs. of  7 variables:\n $ state_abbr    : chr  \"AL\" \"AL\" \"AL\" \"AL\" ...\n $ historical    : chr  \"red\" \"red\" \"red\" \"red\" ...\n $ county_name   : chr  \"Autauga County\" \"Baldwin County\" \"Barbour County\" \"Bibb County\" ...\n $ total_votes_20: int  27770 109679 10518 9595 27588 4613 9488 50983 15284 12301 ...\n $ repub_pct_20  : num  71.4 76.2 53.5 78.4 89.6 ...\n $ dem_pct_20    : num  27.02 22.41 45.79 20.7 9.57 ...\n $ dem_support_20: chr  \"low\" \"low\" \"low\" \"low\" ...\n\n\nWe can fix this by using fct_relevel() to both:\n\nStore dem_support_20 as a factor variable, the levels of which are recognized as specific levels or categories, not just words.\nSpecify a meaningful order for the levels of the factor variable.\n\n\n# Notice that the order of the levels is not alphabetical!\nelections &lt;- elections |&gt; \n  mutate(dem_support_20 = fct_relevel(dem_support_20, c(\"low\", \"medium\", \"high\")))\n\n# Notice the new structure of the dem_support_20 variable\nstr(elections)\n\n'data.frame':   3109 obs. of  7 variables:\n $ state_abbr    : chr  \"AL\" \"AL\" \"AL\" \"AL\" ...\n $ historical    : chr  \"red\" \"red\" \"red\" \"red\" ...\n $ county_name   : chr  \"Autauga County\" \"Baldwin County\" \"Barbour County\" \"Bibb County\" ...\n $ total_votes_20: int  27770 109679 10518 9595 27588 4613 9488 50983 15284 12301 ...\n $ repub_pct_20  : num  71.4 76.2 53.5 78.4 89.6 ...\n $ dem_pct_20    : num  27.02 22.41 45.79 20.7 9.57 ...\n $ dem_support_20: Factor w/ 3 levels \"low\",\"medium\",..: 1 1 1 1 1 3 1 1 1 1 ...\n\n\n\n# And plot dem_support_20\nggplot(elections, aes(x = dem_support_20)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 3: Change Labels using fct_recode\n\nWe now have a factor variable, dem_support_20, with categories that are ordered in a meaningful way:\n\nelections |&gt; \n  count(dem_support_20)\n\n  dem_support_20    n\n1            low 2494\n2         medium  157\n3           high  458\n\n\nBut maybe we want to change up the category labels. For demo purposes, let’s create a new factor variable, results_20, that’s the same as dem_support_20 but with different category labels:\n\n# We can redefine any number of the category labels.\n# Here we'll relabel all 3 categories:\nelections &lt;- elections |&gt; \n  mutate(results_20 = fct_recode(dem_support_20, \n                                 \"strong republican\" = \"low\",\n                                 \"close race\" = \"medium\",\n                                 \"strong democrat\" = \"high\"))\n\n# Check it out\n# Note that the new category labels are still in a meaningful,\n# not necessarily alphabetical, order!\nelections |&gt; \n  count(results_20)\n\n         results_20    n\n1 strong republican 2494\n2        close race  157\n3   strong democrat  458\n\n\nExample 4: Re-order Levels using fct_relevel\n\nFinally, let’s explore how the Republican vote varied from county to county within each state:\n\n# Note that we're just piping the data into ggplot instead of writing\n# it as the first argument\nelections |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = state_abbr)) + \n    geom_density(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is too many density plots to put on top of one another. Let’s spread these out while keeping them in the same frame, hence easier to compare, using a joy plot or ridge plot:\n\nlibrary(ggridges)\nelections |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = repub_pct_20, y = state_abbr, fill = historical)) + \n    geom_density_ridges() + \n    scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOK, but this is alphabetical. Suppose we want to reorder the states according to their typical Republican support. Recall that we did something similar in Example 2, using fct_relevel() to specify a meaningful order for the dem_support_20 categories:\nfct_relevel(dem_support_20, c(\"low\", \"medium\", \"high\"))\nWe could use fct_relevel() to reorder the states here, but what would be the drawbacks?\nExample 5: Re-order levels Based on Another Variable using fct_reorder\n\nWhen a meaningful order for the categories of a factor variable can be defined by another variable in our dataset, we can use fct_reorder(). In our joy plot, let’s reorder the states according to their median Republican support:\n\n# Since we might want states to be alphabetical in other parts of our analysis,\n# we'll pipe the data into the ggplot without storing it:\nelections |&gt; \n  mutate(state_abbr = fct_reorder(state_abbr, repub_pct_20, .fun = \"median\")) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = repub_pct_20, y = state_abbr, fill = historical)) + \n    geom_density_ridges() + \n    scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# How did the code change?\n# And the corresponding output?\nelections |&gt; \n  mutate(state_abbr = fct_reorder(state_abbr, repub_pct_20, .fun = \"median\", .desc = TRUE)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = repub_pct_20, y = state_abbr, fill = historical)) + \n    geom_density_ridges() + \n    scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\nThe forcats package, part of the tidyverse, includes handy functions for working with categorical variables (for + cats):\n\nHere are just some, few of which we explored above:\n\nfunctions for changing the order of factor levels\n\n\nfct_relevel() = manually reorder levels\n\nfct_reorder() = reorder levels according to values of another variable\n\n\nfct_infreq() = order levels from highest to lowest frequency\n\nfct_rev() = reverse the current order\n\n\nfunctions for changing the labels or values of factor levels\n\n\nfct_recode() = manually change levels\n\nfct_lump() = group together least common levels",

    "text": "22.1 Exercises\nSuppose our goal is to work with data on movie reviews, and that we’ve already gone through the work to find a dataset. The imdb_5000_messy.csv file is posted on Moodle. Let’s work with it!\nExercise 1: Save Data Locally\nPart a\nOn your laptop:\n\nDownload the “imdb_5000_messy.csv” file from Moodle\nMove it to the data folder in your portfolio repository\nPart b\nHot tip: After saving your data file, it’s important to record appropriate citations and info in either a new qmd (eg: “imdb_5000_messy_README.qmd”) or in the qmd where you’ll analyze the data. These citations should include:\n\nthe data source, i.e. where you found the data\nthe data creator, i.e. who / what group collected the original data\npossibly a data codebook, i.e. descriptions of the data variables\n\nTo this end, check out where we originally got our IMDB data:\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata\nAfter visiting that website, take some quick notes here on the data source and creator.\n\nThe data was found in kaggle and is originally from The Movie Database (TMDb)\n\nExercise 2: Import Data to RStudio\nNow that we have a local copy of our data file, let’s get it into RStudio! Remember that this process depends on 2 things: the file type and location. Since our file type is a csv, we can import it using read_csv(). But we have to supply the file location through a file path. To this end, we can either use an absolute file path or a relative file path.\nPart a\nAn absolute file path describes the location of a file starting from the root or home directory. How we refer to the user root directory depends upon your machine:\n\nOn a Mac: ~\n\nOn Windows: typically C:\\\n\n\nThen the complete file path to the IMDB data file in the data folder, depending on your machine an where you created your portfolio project, can be:\n\nOn a Mac: ~/Desktop/portfolio/data/imdb_5000_messy.csv\n\nOn Windows: C:\\Desktop\\portfolio\\data\\imdb_5000_messy.csv or C:\\\\Desktop\\\\portfolio\\\\data\\\\imdb_5000_messy.csv\n\n\nPutting this together, use read_csv() with the appropriate absolute file path to import your data into RStudio. Save this as imdb_messy.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nimdb_messy &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Documents/GitHub/portfolio-kherrera23/data/imdb_5000_messy.csv\")\n\nPart b\nAbsolute file paths can get really long, depending upon our number of sub-folders, and they should not be used when sharing code with other and instead relative file paths should be used. A relative file path describes the location of a file from the current “working directory”, i.e. where RStudio would currently look for on your computer. Check what your working directory is inside this qmd:\n\n# This should be the folder where you stored this qmd!\ngetwd()\n\n[1] \"/Users/kirstyherrera/Documents/GitHub/portfolio-kherrera23/ica\"\n\n\nNext, check what the working directory is for the console by typing getwd() in the console. This is probably different, meaning that the relative file paths that will work in your qmd won’t work in the console! You can either exclusively work inside your qmd, or change the working directory in your console, by navigating to the following in the upper toolbar: Session &gt; Set Working Directory &gt; To Source File location.\nPart c\nAs a good practice, we created a data folder and saved our data file (imdb_5000_messy.csv) into.\nSince our .qmd analysis and .csv data live in the same project, we don’t have to write out absolute file paths that go all the way to the root directory. We can use relative file paths that start from where our code file exists to where the data file exist:\n\nOn a Mac: ../data/imdb_5000_messy.csv\n\nOn Windows: ..\\data\\imdb_5000_messy.csv or ..\\\\data\\\\imdb_5000_messy.csv\n\n\nNOTE: .. means go up one level in the file hierarchy, ie, go to the parent folder/directory.\nPutting this together, use read_csv() with the appropriate relative file path to import your data into RStudio. Save this as imdb_temp (temp for “temporary”). Convince yourself that this worked, i.e. you get the same dataset as imdb_messy.\n\nimdb_temp &lt;- read_csv(\"../data/imdb_5000_messy.csv\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile Paths\n\n\n\nAbsolute file paths should be used when referring to files hosed on the web, eg, https://mac-stat.github.io/data/kiva_partners2.csv. In all other instances, relative file paths should be used.\n\n\nPart d: OPTIONAL\nSometimes, we don’t want to import the entire dataset. For example, we might want to…\n\nskips some rows, eg, if they’re just “filler”\nonly import the first “n” rows, eg, if the dataset is really large\nonly import a random subset of “n” rows, eg, if the dataset is really large\n\nThe “data import cheat sheet” at the top of this qmd, or Google, are handy resources here. As one example…\n\n# Try importing only the first 5 rows\n read_csv(\"../data/imdb_5000_messy.csv\", n_max = 5)\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 29\n   ...1 color director_name     num_critic_for_reviews duration\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                              &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     1 Color James Cameron                        723      178\n2     2 Color Gore Verbinski                       302      169\n3     3 Color Sam Mendes                           602      148\n4     4 Color Christopher Nolan                    813      164\n5     5 &lt;NA&gt;  Doug Walker                           NA       NA\n# ℹ 24 more variables: director_facebook_likes &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   actor_3_facebook_likes &lt;dbl&gt;, actor_2_name &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   actor_1_facebook_likes &lt;dbl&gt;, gross &lt;dbl&gt;, genres &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   actor_1_name &lt;chr&gt;, movie_title &lt;chr&gt;, num_voted_users &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   cast_total_facebook_likes &lt;dbl&gt;, actor_3_name &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   facenumber_in_poster &lt;dbl&gt;, plot_keywords &lt;chr&gt;, movie_imdb_link &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   num_user_for_reviews &lt;dbl&gt;, language &lt;chr&gt;, country &lt;chr&gt;, …\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommenting/Uncommenting Code\n\n\n\nTo comment/uncomment several lines of code at once, highlight them then click ctrl/cmd+shift+c.\n\n\nExercise 3: Check Data\nAfter importing new data into RStudio, you MUST do some quick checks of the data. Here are two first steps that are especially useful.\nPart a\nOpen imdb_messy in the spreadsheet-like viewer by typing View(imdb_messy) in the console. Sort this “spreadsheet” by different variables by clicking on the arrows next to the variable names. Do you notice anything unexpected?\nPart b\nDo a quick summary() of each variable in the dataset. One way to do this is below:\n\n imdb_messy |&gt;\n   mutate(across(where(is.character), as.factor)) |&gt;  # convert characters to factors in order to summarize\n   summary()\n\n      ...1                  color               director_name \n Min.   :   1   B&W            :  10   Steven Spielberg:  26  \n 1st Qu.:1262   Black and White: 199   Woody Allen     :  22  \n Median :2522   color          :  30   Clint Eastwood  :  20  \n Mean   :2522   Color          :4755   Martin Scorsese :  20  \n 3rd Qu.:3782   COLOR          :  30   Ridley Scott    :  17  \n Max.   :5043   NA's           :  19   (Other)         :4834  \n                                       NA's            : 104  \n num_critic_for_reviews    duration     director_facebook_likes\n Min.   :  1.0          Min.   :  7.0   Min.   :    0.0        \n 1st Qu.: 50.0          1st Qu.: 93.0   1st Qu.:    7.0        \n Median :110.0          Median :103.0   Median :   49.0        \n Mean   :140.2          Mean   :107.2   Mean   :  686.5        \n 3rd Qu.:195.0          3rd Qu.:118.0   3rd Qu.:  194.5        \n Max.   :813.0          Max.   :511.0   Max.   :23000.0        \n NA's   :50             NA's   :15      NA's   :104            \n actor_3_facebook_likes          actor_2_name  actor_1_facebook_likes\n Min.   :    0.0        Morgan Freeman :  20   Min.   :     0        \n 1st Qu.:  133.0        Charlize Theron:  15   1st Qu.:   614        \n Median :  371.5        Brad Pitt      :  14   Median :   988        \n Mean   :  645.0        James Franco   :  11   Mean   :  6560        \n 3rd Qu.:  636.0        Meryl Streep   :  11   3rd Qu.: 11000        \n Max.   :23000.0        (Other)        :4959   Max.   :640000        \n NA's   :23             NA's           :  13   NA's   :7             \n     gross                            genres             actor_1_name \n Min.   :      162   Drama               : 236   Robert De Niro:  49  \n 1st Qu.:  5340988   Comedy              : 209   Johnny Depp   :  41  \n Median : 25517500   Comedy|Drama        : 191   Nicolas Cage  :  33  \n Mean   : 48468408   Comedy|Drama|Romance: 187   J.K.

Is there anything you’d need to clean before using this data?\nExercise 4: Clean Data: Factor Variables 1\nIf you didn’t already in Exercise 3, check out the color variable in the imdb_messy dataset.\n\nWhat’s goofy about this / what do we need to fix? There are 5 categories for something that could be two.\nMore specifically, what different categories does the color variable take, and how many movies fall into each of these categories? The way the variable is writen affects the counting.\n\n\nimdb_messy |&gt;\n  count(color)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  color               n\n  &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;int&gt;\n1 B&W                10\n2 Black and White   199\n3 COLOR              30\n4 Color            4755\n5 color              30\n6 &lt;NA&gt;               19\n\n\nExercise 5: Clean Data: Factor Variables 2\nWhen working with categorical variables like color, the categories must be “clean”, i.e. consistent and in the correct format. Let’s make that happen.\nPart a\nWe could open the .csv file in, say, Excel or Google sheets, clean up the color variable, save a clean copy, and then reimport that into RStudio. BUT that would be the wrong thing to do. Why is it important to use R code, which we then save inside this qmd, to clean our data?\n\nThat wouldn’t be reproducible\n\nPart b\nLet’s use R code to change the color variable so that it appropriately combines the various categories into only 2: Color and Black_White. We’ve learned a couple sets of string-related tools that could be handy here. First, starting with the imdb_messy data, change the color variable using one of the functions we learned in the Factors lesson.\nfct_relevel(), fct_recode(), fct_reorder()\nStore your results in imdb_temp (don’t overwrite imdb_messy). To check your work, print out a count() table of the color variable in imdb_temp.\n\nimdb_temp &lt;- imdb_messy |&gt;\n  mutate(color = fct_recode(color,\n                            \"Color\" = \"COLOR\",\n                            \"Color\" = \"color\",\n                            \"Black_White\" = \"B&W\",\n                            \"Black_White\" = \"Black and White\"))\n\nimdb_temp |&gt;\n  count(color)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  color           n\n  &lt;fct&gt;       &lt;int&gt;\n1 Black_White   209\n2 Color        4815\n3 &lt;NA&gt;           19\n\n\nPart c\nRepeat Part b using one of our string functions from the String lesson:\nstr_replace(), str_replace_all(), str_to_lower(), str_sub(), str_length(), str_detect()\n\nimdb_temp &lt;- imdb_messy |&gt;\n  mutate(color = str_replace(color, \"COLOR\", \"Color\"),\n         color = str_replace(color, \"color\", \"Color\"),\n         color = str_replace(color, \"B&W\", \"Black_White\"),\n         color = str_replace(color, \"Black and White\", \"Black_White\"))\n\nimdb_temp |&gt;\n  count(color)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  color           n\n  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;int&gt;\n1 Black_White   209\n2 Color        4815\n3 &lt;NA&gt;           19\n\n\nExercise 6: Clean Data: Missing Data 1\nThroughout these exercises, you’ve probably noticed that there’s a bunch of missing data. This is encoded as NA (not available) in R. There are a few questions to address about missing data:\n\n\nHow many values are missing data? What’s the volume of the missingness?\n\nWhy are some values missing?\n\nWhat should we do about the missing values?\n\nLet’s consider the first 2 questions in this exercise.\nPart a\nAs a first step, let’s simply understand the volume of NAs. Specifically:\n\n# Count the total number of rows in imdb_messy\nnrow(imdb_messy)\n\n[1] 5043\n\n# Then count the number of NAs in each column\ncolSums(is.na(imdb_messy))\n\n                     ...1                     color             director_name \n                        0                        19                       104 \n   num_critic_for_reviews                  duration   director_facebook_likes \n                       50                        15                       104 \n   actor_3_facebook_likes              actor_2_name    actor_1_facebook_likes \n                       23                        13                         7 \n                    gross                    genres              actor_1_name \n                      884                         0                         7 \n              movie_title           num_voted_users cast_total_facebook_likes \n                        0                         0                         0 \n             actor_3_name      facenumber_in_poster             plot_keywords \n                       23                        13                       153 \n          movie_imdb_link      num_user_for_reviews                  language \n                        0                        21                        12 \n                  country            content_rating                    budget \n                        5                       303                       492 \n               title_year    actor_2_facebook_likes                imdb_score \n                      108                        13                         0 \n             aspect_ratio      movie_facebook_likes \n                      329                         0 \n\n# Then count the number of NAs in a specific column\nimdb_messy |&gt; \n  summarise(num_NAs = sum(is.na(actor_1_facebook_likes)))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  num_NAs\n    &lt;int&gt;\n1       7\n\n\nPart b\nAs a second step, let’s think about why some values are missing. Study the individual observations with NAs carefully. Why do you think they are missing? Are certain films more likely to have more NAs than others?\nPart c\nConsider a more specific example. Obtain a dataset of movies that are missing data on actor_1_facebook_likes. Then explain why you think there are NAs.

There is no perfect or universal approach here. Rather, we must think carefully about…\n\nWhy the values are missing?\nWhat we want to do with our data?\nWhat is the impact of removing or replacing missing data on our work / conclusions?\n\nPart a\nCalculate the average duration of a film.

Not it was not need it a new data set.\nPart b\nTry out the drop_na() function:\n\nimdb_temp &lt;- drop_na(imdb_messy)\nnrow(imdb_temp)\n\n[1] 3756\n\n\nFollow-up questions:\n\nWhat did drop_na() do? How many data points are left? Dropped all the data points with missing information in any column, now we have 3756 rows.\nIn what situations might this function be a good idea? When need it to use all the variables\nIn what situations might this function be a bad idea? If you are just working with certain column where all movies have it and you lose some rows fro missing information in a variable that do not affect your project.\nPart c\ndrop_na() removes data points that have any NA values, even if we don’t care about the variable(s) for which data is missing. This can result in losing a lot of data points that do have data on the variables we actually care about! For example, suppose we only want to explore the relationship between film duration and whether it’s in color. Check out a plot:\n\nggplot(imdb_messy, aes(x = duration, fill = color)) + \n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow-up:\n\nCreate a new dataset with only and all movies that have complete info on duration and color. HINT: You could use !is.na(___) or drop_na() (differently than above)\nUse this new dataset to create a new and improved plot.\nHow many movies remain in your new dataset? Hence why this is better than using the dataset from part b?\n\n\nimdb_temp &lt;- imdb_messy |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(duration), !is.na(color))\n\ndim(imdb_temp)\n\n[1] 5010   29\n\nggplot(imdb_temp, aes(x = duration, fill = color)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart d\nIn some cases, missing data is more non-data than unknown data. For example, the films with NAs for actor_1_facebook_likes actually have 0 Facebook likes–they don’t even have actors! In these cases, we can replace the NAs with a 0. Use the replace_na() function to create a new dataset (imdb_temp) that replaces the NAs in actor_1_facebook_likes with 0. You’ll have to check out the help file for this function.\n\nimdb_temp &lt;- imdb_messy |&gt;\n  mutate(actor_1_facebook_likes =\n           replace_na(actor_1_facebook_likes, 0))\n\nimdb_temp |&gt;\n  summarise(sum(is.na(actor_1_facebook_likes)))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  `sum(is.na(actor_1_facebook_likes))`\n                                 &lt;int&gt;\n1                                    0\n\n\nExercise 8: New Data + Projects\nLet’s practice the above ideas while also planting some seeds for the course project. Each group will pick and analyze their own dataset. The people you’re sitting with today aren’t necessarily your project groups! BUT do some brainstorming together:\n\nShare with each other: What are some personal hobbies or passions or things you’ve been thinking about or things you’d like to learn more about? Don’t think too hard about this! Just share what’s at the top of mind today.\nEach individual: Find a dataset online that’s related to one of the topics you shared in the above prompt.\nDiscuss what data you found with your group!\nLoad the data into RStudio, perform some basic checks, and perform some preliminary cleaning, as necessary.",

How was it measured? Self-reported through a questionnaire? Directly?, why: Who funded the data collection? What was the purposes? To whose benefit was the data collected? Answers to such questions strongly impact the conclusions you will be able to draw from the data.↩︎",
