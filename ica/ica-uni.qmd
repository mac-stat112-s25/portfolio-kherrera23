## Exercises

```{r}
#| eval: true

# Import data
hikes <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/high_peaks.csv")
```

### Exercise 1: Research Questions

Let's dig into the `hikes` data, starting with the `elevation` and difficulty `ratings` of the hikes:

```{r}
#| eval: true

head(hikes)
```

a.  What features would we like a visualization of the *categorical* difficulty `rating` variable to capture?
> how many peaks are in each category of difficulty rating

b.  What about a visualization of the *quantitative* `elevation` variable?
> What is the average elevation of the peaks listed, or which are the max and min elevations included in the data set. 


### Exercise 2: Load tidyverse

We'll address the above questions using `ggplot` tools. Try running the following chunk and simply take note of the error message -- this is one you'll get a lot!

```{r}
# Use the ggplot function
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating))
```

In order to use `ggplot` tools, we have to first *load* the `tidyverse` package in which they live. We've *installed* the package but we need to tell R when we want to *use* it. Run the chunk below to load the library. You'll need to do this within any .qmd file that uses `ggplot()`.

```{r}
# Load the package
library(tidyverse)
```


### Exercise 3: Bar Chart of Ratings - Part 1 

Consider some specific research questions about the difficulty `rating` of the hikes:

1. How many hikes fall into each category?
2. Are the hikes evenly distributed among these categories, or are some more common than others?

All of these questions can be answered with: (1) a **bar chart**; of (2) the *categorical* data recorded in the `rating` column. First, set up the plotting **frame**:

```{r}
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating))
```

Think about:

-   What did this do? What do you observe?
> This ggplot indicates that the information is being take from the data set hikes and the x-axis will be the rating column 

-   What, in general, is the first argument of the `ggplot()` function?
> The name of the data set we are taking variables from

-   What is the purpose of writing `x = rating`?
> Assigned the x-axis the variables of the column rating 

-   What do you think `aes` stands for?!?
> It stands for aesthetic


### Exercise 4: Bar Chart of Ratings - Part 2 

Now let's add a **geometric layer** to the frame / canvas, and start customizing the plot's **theme**. To this end, try each chunk below, *one by one*. In each chunk, make a comment about how both the code and the corresponding plot both changed.

NOTE:

-   Pay attention to the general code properties and structure, not memorization.
-   Not all of these are "good" plots. We're just exploring `ggplot`.

```{r}
# This code add a geometric visualization call geom_bar, which refers to a bar plot.
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +
  geom_bar()
```

```{r}
# This code add labels to the x and y-axis.
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Rating", y = "Number of hikes")
```

```{r}
# This code add color to the fill of the bar plot
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "blue") +
  labs(x = "Rating", y = "Number of hikes")
```
```{r}
# This code add a minimal theme which simplifies the plot design.
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +
  geom_bar(color = "orange", fill = "blue")  +
  labs(x = "Rating", y = "Number of hikes") +
  theme_minimal()
```



### Exercise 5: Bar Chart Follow-up 

#### Part a

Reflect on the `ggplot()` code.

-   What's the purpose of the `+`? When do we use it?
> It allows you to add "instructions" to the code and customized the visualization.

-   We added the bars using `geom_bar()`? Why "geom"?
> It comes form geometric elements

-   What does `labs()` stand for?
> labels 

-   What's the difference between `color` and `fill`?
> colors is the outline while fill paint the inside of the bar

#### Part b

In general, bar charts allow us to examine the following properties of a *categorical* variable:

-   **observed categories**: What categories did we observe?
> Difficulty rating: difficult, easy, moderate.

-   **variability between categories**: Are observations evenly spread out among the categories, or are some categories more common than others?
> The moderate categorie is more common than eady and difficult ones. 

We must then *translate* this information into the *context* of our analysis, here hikes in the Adirondacks. Summarize below what you learned from the bar chart, in context.

#### Part c

Is there anything you don't like about this barplot? For example: check out the x-axis again.
> The difficulty ratings are not in order, I would like it to be from easy towards difficult because otherwise could be misleading. 


### Exercise 6: Sad Bar Chart

Let's now consider some research questions related to the *quantitative* `elevation` variable:

1. Among the hikes, what's the *range* of elevation and how are the hikes *distributed* within this range (e.g. evenly, in clumps, "normally")?
2. What's a *typical* elevation?
3. Are there any *outliers*, i.e. hikes that have unusually high or low elevations?

Here:

-   Construct a **bar chart** of the *quantitative* `elevation` variable.
-   Explain why this might *not* be an effective visualization for this and other quantitative variables. (What questions does / doesn't it help answer?)

```{r}
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_bar()
```
> Bar chart is not an effective visualization for quantitative variables because the data recorded is specific for each peak and therefore a singular bar will be created for each make it hard to read and compared. It could help ask the question of how many peaks have the same elevation but for example in this data set this happens twice as much, therefore the information might not be meaningful. 


### Exercise 7: A Histogram of Elevation

Quantitative variables require different viz than categorical variables. Especially when there are many possible outcomes of the quantitative variable. It's typically insufficient to simply count up the number of times we've observed a particular outcome as the bar graph did above. It gives us a sense of ranges and typical outcomes, but not a good sense of how the observations are distributed across this range. We'll explore two methods for graphing quantitative variables: **histograms** and **density plots**.

**Histograms** are constructed by (1) dividing up the observed range of the variable into 'bins' of equal width; and (2) counting up the number of cases that fall into each bin. Check out the example below:

![](https://mac-stat.github.io/images/112/histogram_demo.png){width="50%"}

#### Part a

Let's dig into some details.

-   How many hikes have an elevation between 4500 and 4700 feet?
> Approx 6 hikes

-   How many total hikes have an elevation of at least 5100 feet?
> Around 2 hikes

#### Part b

Now the bigger picture. In general, histograms allow us to examine the following properties of a *quantitative* variable:

-   **typical outcome:** Where’s the center of the data points? What's typical?
-   **variability & range:** How spread out are the outcomes? What are the max and min outcomes?
-   **shape:** How are values distributed along the observed range? Is the distribution symmetric, right-skewed, left-skewed, bi-modal, or uniform (flat)?
-   **outliers:** Are there any outliers, i.e. outcomes that are unusually large/small?

We must then *translate* this information into the *context* of our analysis, here hikes in the Adirondacks. Addressing each of the features in the above list, summarize below what you learned from the histogram, in context.
> The range of elecation in the hikes in the Adirondacks is between 4,000 and 5,500 feet. The visualization is a negative riht-skewed, which means that hikes with less elevation are more common than the ones with less elevation. 


### Exercise 8: Building Histograms - Part 1

2-MINUTE CHALLENGE: Thinking of the bar chart code, try to *intuit* what line you can tack on to the below frame of `elevation` to add a histogram layer. Don't forget a `+`. If it doesn't come to you within 2 minutes, *no problem* -- all will be revealed in the next exercise.

```{r}
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram()
```


### Exercise 9: Building Histograms - Part 2

Let's build some histograms. Try each chunk below, *one by one*. In each chunk, make a comment about how both the code and the corresponding plot both changed.

```{r}
# This code adda an histogram layer
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

```{r}
# This code adds a white outline to the histogram
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white") 
```

```{r}
# This code a fill color to the histogram
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", fill = "blue") 
```

```{r}
# This code as labels to the x and y-axis
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white") +
  labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Number of hikes")
```

```{r}
# This code increased the width of the histogram's bins
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", binwidth = 1000) +
  labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Number of hikes")
```

```{r}
# This code decreased the width of the histogram's bins
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", binwidth = 5) +
  labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Number of hikes")
```

```{r}
# This code changed the width of the histogram's bins to 200
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", binwidth = 200) +
  labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Number of hikes")
```


### Exercise 10: Histogram Follow-up 

-   What function added the histogram layer / geometry?
> geom_histogram 

-   What's the difference between `color` and `fill`?
> the color outline the shape of the plot while the fill put color to the binss 

-   Why does adding `color = "white"` improve the visualization?
> It highlights each bin and improve the analysis of the visualization.

-   What did `binwidth` do?
> change the width of the bins in the histograms 

-   Why does the histogram become ineffective if the `binwidth` is too big (e.g. 1000 feet)?
> The vizualization cannot show all the data points.

-   Why does the histogram become ineffective if the `binwidth` is too small (e.g. 5 feet)?
> The histogram becomes harder to read and the difference between bins get lost. 


### Exercise 11: Density Plots

**Density plots** are essentially smooth versions of the histogram. Instead of sorting observations into discrete bins, the "density" of observations is calculated across the entire range of outcomes. The greater the number of observations, the greater the density! The density is then scaled so that the area under the density curve **always equals 1** and the area under any fraction of the curve represents the fraction of cases that lie in that range.

Check out a density plot of elevation. Notice that the y-axis (density) has no contextual interpretation -- it's a relative measure. The *higher* the density, the more *common* are elevations in that range.

```{r}
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_density()
```

**Questions**

-   INTUITION CHECK: Before tweaking the code and thinking back to `geom_bar()` and `geom_histogram()`, how do you *anticipate* the following code will change the plot?

    -   `geom_density(color = "blue")`
    -   `geom_density(fill = "orange")`

-   TRY IT! Test out those lines in the chunk below. Was your intuition correct?

```{r}
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_density(color = "blue", fill = "orange")
```

-   Examine the density plot. How does it compare to the histogram? What does it tell you about the *typical* elevation, *variability / range* in elevations, and *shape* of the distribution of *elevations* within this range?



### Exercise 12: Density Plots vs Histograms

The histogram and density plot both allow us to visualize the behavior of a quantitative variable: typical outcome, variability / range, shape, and outliers. What are the pros/cons of each? What do you like/not like about each?


### Exercise 13: Code = communication

We *obviously* won't be done until we talk about communication. All code above has a similar *general* structure (where the details can change):

```{r}
#| eval: false

ggplot(___, aes(x = ___)) + 
  geom___(color = "___", fill = "___") + 
  labs(x = "___", y = "___")
```

-   Though not *necessary* to the code working, it's common, good practice to *indent* or *tab* the lines of code after the first line (counterexample below). Why?

```{r}
# YUCK
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
geom_histogram(color = "white", binwidth = 200) +
labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Number of hikes")
```

-   Though not *necessary* to the code working, it's common, good practice to put a *line break* after each `+` (counterexample below). Why?

```{r}
# YUCK 
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) + geom_histogram(color = "white", binwidth = 200) + labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Number of hikes")
```
