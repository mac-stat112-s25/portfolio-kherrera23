Use this file to generate a professional looking **univariate** visualization. The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r}
library(mosaic)
library(tidyverse)
library(fivethirtyeight)

survey <- read.csv("https://ajohns24.github.io/data/112/about_us_2024.csv")

ggplot(survey, aes(x = fct_infreq(hangout))) +
  labs( 
    title = "Macalester College students's favorite places to hang out",
    x = "Place", 
    y = "Amount of Students") +
  geom_bar(fill = "skyblue", color = "pink") +
  theme_minimal()
