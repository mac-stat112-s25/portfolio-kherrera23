title: "Trivariate Viz"
---

Use this file to generate a professional looking **trivariate** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

weather <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/weather_3_locations.csv") |> 
  mutate(date = as.Date(date))  

ggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am, color = location, shape = raintoday)) + 
  labs(
    title = "The relationship of 9am and 3pm weather in Australian cities",
    x = "Temperature at 9 am",
    y = "temperature at 3 pm"
  ) +
  geom_point()
```
