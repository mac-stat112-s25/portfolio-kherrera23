title: "Trivariate Viz"
---

Use this file to generate a professional looking **trivariate** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r}

library(mosaic)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
data("Birthdays")
head(Birthdays)
library(lubridate)

daily_births <- Birthdays |>
  group_by(date) |>
  summarise(total = sum(births)) |>
  mutate(year = year(date),
            week_day = wday(date, label = TRUE),
            month_day = day(date))

daily_births_1980 <- daily_births |>
  filter(year == 1980)

ggplot(daily_births_1980, aes(y = total, x = date, color = week_day)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6, size = 1.5) +
  scale_color_viridis_d(option = "plasma", name = "Day of the Week") +
  labs(
    title = "Daily Births in 1980 by Day of the Week",
    x = "Date",
    y = "Number of Births") +
  theme_minimal()
