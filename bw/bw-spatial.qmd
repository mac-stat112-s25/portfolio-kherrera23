title: "Spatial Viz"
---

Use this file to generate a professional looking **spatial** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(openintro)
library(sf)
library(maps)
library(leaflet)
library(rnaturalearth)
library(mosaic)

agencies <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-02-18/agencies.csv')

states_map <- map_data("state")

state_counts <- agencies %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  summarise(num_agencies = n()) %>%
  mutate(state = tolower(state))

ggplot(state_counts, aes(map_id = state, fill = num_agencies)) +
  geom_map(map = states_map) +
  labs(title = "Geographic Distribution of Reporting Agencies",
       fill = "Number of Agencies",
       caption = "Source: FBI UCR Program") +
  expand_limits(x = states_map$long, y = states_map$lat) +
  theme_void() +
  scale_fill_viridis_c()
